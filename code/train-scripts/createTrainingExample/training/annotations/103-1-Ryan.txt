investigate medieval peoples perspectives of their, and others, societies. we do this in order to provide you both the opportunity to increase and enhance your own knowledge of history and to allow you to grow intellectually. by regarding the medieval past, you will gain further insights into how it has affected the development and the workings of the modern world. course objectives and requirements: during the main lectures in this class, you will hear a narrative that outlines the sweep of medieval history from the fifth through the fifteenth centuries. outside of class, you will read a variety of primary sources from the medieval period. you will become familiar with the techniques of primary source analysis, in order to determine what the documents reveal to, and what they hide from, their intended audiences. by the end of the semester, you will be able to conduct primary source analysis and have a thorough understanding of the larger narrative of medieval history. you, the student, will be responsible for the following tasks: i. daily attendance and participation. participation includes engaging with various in-class activities by being alert and attentive. this means cell phones are to be turned off, text messaging is prohibited, and laptops are to be used solely for taking notes. attendance will be determined through a series of various pop quizzes issued over the course of the semester. an excused absence is one that can be verified by an outside source (for example, a doctors note or a mechanics bill). my attendance policy is as follows: i allow for no more than three (3) non- excused absences from this class. if you miss class, you are responsible for getting any notes and assignments. you may see your tas to receive missed notes. subsequent non-excused absences from class will lower your overall course grade by one entire letter grade. multiple absences, although excused, may result in your receiving an incomplete for a final course grade. should that happen, you will need to meet with me and your teaching assistant before the end of the semester to establish an appropriate timetable in which you must complete all missing work. unsuccessfully fulfilling those assigned tasks within the prescribed timetable will result in an overall failing grade for the class. ii. writing two (2) brief analytical essays, of three to four (3-4) pages each, based on the primary source readings that youve read. the essays themes will be handed out during a later class. they must be turned in on the day they are due 2>>5

such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individualemployment or academic performance or creating an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment for that individualemployment, education, or participation in a university activity." sexual harassment by or toward a member of the university community is prohibited. if you have any questions or concerns about this definition, or experience any unwelcome behavior that seems to fit this description, please contact me, another faculty member, or the sexual harassment advisors network: network@sla.purdue.edu academic misconduct: purdue prohibits dishonesty in connection with any university activity. cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing false information to the university are examples of dishonesty. [university regulations, part 5, section iii, b, 2, a] furthermore, the university senate has stipulated the commitment of acts of cheating, lying, and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as the use of substitutes for taking examinations, the use of illegal cribs, plagiarism, and copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be tolerated. moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly or indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in itself dishonest.[university senate document 72-18, december 15, 1972]. the universitys guideline for penalizing academic misconduct recommends giving a grade of f for a plagiarized assignment. plagiarists and cheaters will automatically fail the course and will be immediately reported to the office of the dean of students. if you are worried about committing plagiarism unknowingly, please come and speak with both me and your teaching assistant. for more on what constitutes academic integrity, please see the following site: http://www.purdue.edu/odos/administration/integrity.htm 5>>5
