chem 1bl general chemistry laboratory chemistry 1bl is designed to demonstrate and reinforce the basic concepts of bonding, chemical equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, thermochemistry, and electrochemistry. laboratory techniques such as the use of a voltmeter, ammeter, and calorimetry will be introduced. the analytical methods learned in chem. 1bl are applicable to many other scientific disciplines including biology, medicine, environmental science, physics and engineering. laboratory coordinator: dr. van koppen, office: psbn 3670 b email: vankoppen@ucsb.edu office hours: monday and thursday 2 - 3 pm or by appointment lab>>5

lab manual: general chemistry 1al/1bl/1cl, laboratory manual by petra van koppen, 2019-2020 edition, hayden-mcneil pub. also required: safety glasses, lab coat and a bound, quadrille-ruled, duplicate-page notebook. all are available in the bookstore. note: chem. 1b and 1bl may not be taken p/np by science and engineering majors because these courses are required in preparation for the major. required lab fee: a non- refundable $32.00 lab fee is required for this course. it will be charged to your barc account upon confirmation of your enrollment. chem. 1b/1bl website: https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/ success in chem 1b chemistry is not necessarily a difficult subject, but most students find that they have to spend time every day studying by working problems and reading the text to understand the material.  study an hour every day. cramming before exams is mostly a waste of time. long term retention comes from frequent exposure to material. make it your goal to work chemistry problems and read the text for an hour every day.  read the textbook/lecture notes. read the text and work example problems in the text before the topics are covered in lecture (and perhaps again after). copy over your notes and add questions as you think of them or explain your notes to another student (or figure out another way to process learned concepts to retain information).  attend every lecture, ask questions. the instructor is here to help you learn. ask questions during lecture, after lecture, during office hours, in your clas discussion section and ta office hours.  do your homework: work the assigned problems below! chemistry can be abstract at times and linking conceptual understanding to calculations only comes when you do the work yourself. watching others (e.g. instructors, tutors or other students) work problems or reading the solutions in the solution manual is no substitute for working them yourself. you must go through the reasoning process yourself until you understand each type of problem. sufficient practice is important. work additional problems from the text and from practice quizzes and exams posted on-line. if you needed help doing a problem, mark it so you will do it again later without help.  get help early. if you are struggling with the material get help. instructor office hours, ta office hours, clas, study groups are all available to help you. keep up  get help early.>>5
