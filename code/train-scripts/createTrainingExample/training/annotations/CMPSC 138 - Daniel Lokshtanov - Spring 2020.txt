main point of course: understanding and formal reasoning about computation. what is a computational problem? what is an algorithm? what does it mean for an algorithm to solve a problem? the key concepts here are machine models, such as finite automata, pushdown automata, and turing machines, and the kinds of problems that the different machines can solve. textbook: we will be using the (recommended) textbook: peter linz, an introduction to formal languages and automata, jones and bartlett learning. while we will not force you to buy it, it will be helpful if you get your hands on a copy. we will post pages or chapters from the textbook covering materials from the class, and the notation will be (largely) consistent. practical: this syllabus is tentative. content and timing is subject to change. hw = homework, a date in italic means there is no lecture on that date. a date in bold means exam. all submission deadlines are 23:59 pst of the respective date.>>5
