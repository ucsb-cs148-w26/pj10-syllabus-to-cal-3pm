university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science  ziad matni 2020 cs154 syllabus, spring 2020 page 2 of 8 the live zoom sessions will be recorded for students who may not be able to attend and posted on gauchospace afterwards. by default, your microphone and camera will be muted when you join the session. if you do not want to be included in the recording, simply keep your camera and microphone off. you may ask questions in the chat window. please do not share the recording or any class material with non-students as this is a violation of certain ucsb, state, and federal policies and laws. the instructor reserves the sole legal right to record and distribute this material. the purpose of the lectures in this course is to guide you through the readings and assignments. especially as it pertains to:  provide an overview of how everything fits together,  provide hands-on demonstrations of things that you'll do on your own later,  provide additional information that is not in the textbook/handouts (and to sometimes clarify the textbook/handouts), and  provide an opportunity to ask questions, and hear answers to questions asked by others during office hours. this course moves quickly and covers advanced material, so keeping up with the videos and the readings every week is very important and is key to doing well in this class. labs will not be conducted in a physical lab space and will be completely online instead. i will put up your lab assignments on tuesdays on our main website and you will turn them in by the posted due date. lab t.as will be available for help on lab matters on thursdays from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm via zoom (details on how to call in will be placed on the class main website). most lab assignments require you to use the linux environment. knowledge of linux line commands for basic use is required. you will also be required to code some programs in mips assembly (cs 64) and others in python. even if you have not taken a formal class on python, you are expected to adapt to its use at a beginner/intermediate level (its not difficult). dr. matni will have his office hours on mondays 1:00 pm to 2:30 pm on zoom. you are highly encouraged to call in with your questions. you can also pose questions  and answer each others questions  on piazza. invariably, you are going to have questions on lecture or lab-related stuff. what do you do? your first choice should always be to use piazza to post the question (or see if anyones asked it and received an answer). make it a habit to check piazza many times a week  see if you can answer your fellow students questions yourself! the tas and the instructor will also be using piazza periodically to help you out. please dont use piazza to post outright solutions to homework problems  you can, of course, discuss the exercises and ways to solve the problems. i encourage you to contact me with your questions via piazza. if you have questions that youd rather email me with, then please put cs154 in the subject line. please keep in mind that this is not the only class i teach!>>5

university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science  ziad matni 2020 cs154 syllabus, spring 2020 page 3 of 8 expected conduct although this is an online class, i still expect you to be responsible for your own learning and to ask questions via the channels explained above whenever you have them and to your video viewings and textbook readings as assigned. i expect you to do your own work at all times. please familiarize yourselves with the universitys policies on academic integrity and honesty (see the section in this syllabus that details this further). failure to comply with these policies will result in failing the class (i.e. getting an f on your transcript and being reported to the university). grading this course has multiple assignments, multiple quizzes and one final exam. item grade % assignments 50% exams and quizzes 50% total 100 % class grade distributions these are calculated to 2 decimal places and very strictly assigned. range grade range grade [93  100] a [77  80) c+ [90  93) a- [73  77) c [87  90) b+ [70  73) c- [83  87) b [60  70) d [80  83) b- < 60 f [x  y) means x to y inclusive of x (but not y) a+ grades: these may be awarded to the very best performing students in the classbut the cutoff for a+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no pre- determined cutoff---an average of 97 or more doesn't guarantee you an a+ grade.) if i decide to curve the grade (its not guaranteed that i will), i will do so on the final class scores and not on any individual item. f grades: if you miss your final exam, you will receive an f, regardless of your running score in the class. if you feel that i or the tas have made a mistake (like adding up a grade incorrectly), then you should certainly bring that to my attention in an expedient fashion (within one weeks time), but please do not engage in grade-grubbing (for example, do not ask me to round up your final class grade at the end of the quarter)  please know that i will not engage you in these requests (i.e. i typically ignore these requests). if you have any questions about how grades are computed, please feel free to ask, and i would be happy to explain further.>>5

university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science  ziad matni 2020 cs154 syllabus, spring 2020 page 4 of 8 assignments the (lab) assignments have to be submitted using the gradescope tool. you can only turn in your assignments on gradescope, so emailing them will not be accepted nor graded. if there is an exception to this rule, then the instructor will announce it ahead of time. your assignment will be given to you as a pdf document. you can print it, write on it, then re-scan it, or alternatively edit it directly using various different methods. you then have to submit your assignment as your own pdf document on gradescope. no format other than pdf will be accepted and graded. some assignments allow for the use of a partner. under this setup, students are allowed to form groups of two (but not more!), and may discuss assignment solution details within the group. each member of the group is still accountable for his or her own work (and every individual should turn in a separate assignment), though free communication is permitted within the group. the intention with this setup is that if someone is stuck, they can ask their partner for help without needing to contact the ta or the instructor. students may change groups between assignments, though not within an assignment. forming groups is optional; students may work alone if they want. please, do not copy material from somewhere else without giving it proper citation  otherwise, it will be considered plagiarism (once more, please familiarize yourselves with my policy and the universitys policy on plagiarism). exams instead of a midterm exam, you will have weekly quizzes that you have to take during prescribed times (and no make ups for other times). there will be a final exam that is cumulative of all materials covered. details for this will be provided at a later date. any sign of cheating or plagiarism will result in an f grade and you will be reported to the university. this includes letting other people do the work for you. late policy and make up policy  please read! a late submission means submitting 24 hours after a deadline. late submissions will result in a 20% penalty. anything submitted beyond the deadline + 24 hours will receive a zero. no makeup is allowed for assignments except in rare cases, if there is a documented family emergency, documented extended illness, documented required court appearance, or other situation beyond the students' control (again, with documentation) the instructor may grant additional make up days entirely at the instructor's discretionbut this is not a guarantee or a right. asking for accommodation because i already bought my plane ticket or i have out of town guests that week is a useless exercise and will not work for you. there is no makeup for any quiz or exam. if you believe that a grade on an assignment or a midterm exam is wrong, you may ask for a review for a possible re-grade. in that case, you have to arrange a meeting with your t.a. within 1 week from when the grade was issued (in other words, we will ignore requests for re-grade at some point after that). please have a good reason to ask for a re-grade and understand that it is not a guarantee of a grade change.>>5
