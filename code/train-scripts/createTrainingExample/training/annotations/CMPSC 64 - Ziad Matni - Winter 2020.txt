university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science matni cs64 syllabus, winter 2020, v1 page 2 of 9 make it a habit to check piazza many times a week  see if you can answer your fellow students questions yourself! the tas and the instructor will also be using piazza periodically to help you out. please dont use piazza to post outright solutions to homework problems  you can, of course, discuss the exercises and ways to solve the problems. when emailing us, please use cs64 in the subject line. please keep in mind that this is not the only class i teach, so asking me if i got your email may result in my giving you a blank stare. please dont take it personally!! on that note, i must point out that its also not a good time to ask me questions right before class, as thats precious preparation time for me, and that oftentimes the tas, who will be in class too, may have the answer to your question. remember to periodically go to your tas or instructors office hours for questions you want answered face-to-face. remember: you are bound to make mistakes  and thats ok because you will learn from them. making mistakes means you are learning! do not be afraid of trying something that you initially have no clue about! remember that practicing early and often will make you a better programmer in the end. this means that you should not procrastinate and wait until the last moment to do your assignments. j class format and expected conduct this class meets for lecture twice a week on mondays and wednesdays, with lab on thursdays, which you must attend. for the best learning environment, i need you all to be with me and actively involved. i lecture, but also ask a lot of questions and i expect you to be able to respond, even if you have not raised your hand. in general, i expect that you will all behave like the adults that you are, recognize that you should treat that time with the respect it deserves. class readings are due the day they appear on the syllabus, and i expect every student to have done the reading. diversity of opinions and free expression are encouraged while at the same time courtesy and respect for difference are essential aspects of the classroom climate. additionally, please familiarize yourselves with the universitys policies on academic integrity and honesty (see the section in this syllabus that details this further). only use your laptops for classwork and note-taking. do not bring out your mobile phones! please turn them off or on silent when in class. i may ask you to leave class if i think you are disrupting other students or myself and you will lose significant participation points (at minimum).>>5

university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science matni cs64 syllabus, winter 2020, v1 page 3 of 9 grading this course has multiple assignments, one midterm exam and one final exam. item grade % quizzes / participation 5% assignments 30% midterm exam 30% final exam (cumulative) 35% total 100 % additionally, you can lose points if you miss enough labs (i.e. missing more than 2 of them). the more labs you miss, the more points you lose. class grade distributions these are calculated to 2 decimal places and very strictly assigned. range grade range grade [93  100] a [77  80) c+ [90  93) a- [73  77) c [87  90) b+ [70  73) c- [83  87) b [60  70) d [80  83) b- < 60 f [x  y) means x to y inclusive of x (but not y) a+ grades: these may be awarded to the very best performing students in the classbut the cutoff for a+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no pre- determined cutoff---an average of 97 or more doesn't guarantee you an a+ grade.) if i decide to curve the grade (its not guaranteed that i will), i will do so on the final class scores and not on any individual item. f grades: if you miss your final exam, you will receive an f, regardless of your running score in the class. if you feel that i or the tas have made a mistake (like adding up a grade incorrectly), then you should certainly bring that to my attention in an expedient fashion (within one weeks time), but please do not engage in grade-grubbing (for example, do not ask me to round up your final class grade at the end of the quarter)  please know that i will not engage you in these requests (i.e. i typically ignore these requests). if you have any questions about how grades are computed, please feel free to ask, and i would be happy to explain further. lectures, quizzes & participation the purpose of the lectures in this course is to guide you through the readings, homework, and labs:  to provide an overview of how everything fits together.  to provide hands-on demonstrations of assembly language programming and other things that you'll do on your own later.  to provide additional information that is not in the textbook/handouts (and to sometimes clarify the textbook/handouts).  to provide an opportunity to ask questions, and hear answers to questions asked by others. this course moves quickly. so attendance is very important and is key to doing well in this class. i will give between 3 and 5 unannounced and very short quizzes (i.e. pop-quizzes) in the quarter.>>5

university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science matni cs64 syllabus, winter 2020, v1 page 4 of 9 class participation is vital and highly encouraged. your participation in class is always noted by me and can actually help your final class grade (its not a major factor, but it counts for something). labs the labs meet at phelp 3525 and are run by the tas. please do not switch your registered lab sections before clearing it with the instructor and tas. when you are given a programming assignment, you will typically start working on it in the lab and finish it up on your own time afterwards. not all assignments will need to be done in the lab. attendance will be taken in the labs. all labs require you to use the linux environment. knowledge of linux line commands for basic use is required. please refrain from bringing your laptop to the lab unless you have to (and feel free to use it to do your work at home). labs will take place on thursdays and the assignments are usually due by the following tuesday. exceptions to this will be announced ahead of time. attendance policy: you will earn an attendance point for each lab section. miss more than 2 and you will see it affect your class grade. lack of lab attendance can negatively impact your final class grade. note that you can only earn attendance points if you are there, no matter what the reason is for the absence! there is no way to make up these points. if you know that you need to miss a section, you should inform your ta in advance, and she/he will make a record that you have been responsible, but you will not receive any points for the missed section (if the reason for missing is really important, it should certainly be worth sacrificing a point or two in the class!). im very strict about this lab attendance policy. assignments (30%) the assignments have to be submitted using the gradescope tool. you can only turn in your assignments on gradescope, so handing in hardcopies in class or lab will not be accepted, nor will emailed assignments. if there is an exception to this rule, then the instructor will announce it ahead of time. your assignment will be given to you as either a text file or ms word document. you have to submit your assignment as a pdf onto gradescope. no format other than pdf will be accepted and graded. some assignments allow for the use of a partner. under this setup, students are allowed to form groups of two (but not more!), and may discuss assignment solution details within the group. each member of the group is still accountable for his or her own work (and every individual should turn in a separate assignment), though free communication is permitted within the group. the intention with this setup is that if someone is stuck, they can ask their partner for help without needing to contact the ta or the instructor. students may change groups between assignments, though not within an assignment. forming groups is optional; students may work alone if they want. in actual software development, very little work is done as an individual effort. most modern software systems are simply too big to be undertaken in this style, so collaboration is key. this is one of the reasons why we allow partners for some of the assignments - this represents the common case. that said, collaboration is not simply taking the credit for someone elses work! when this happens, everyone loses. this can (and i have seen it happen countless times) snowball long-term. eventually the student>>5

university of california, santa barbara dept. of computer science matni cs64 syllabus, winter 2020, v1 page 5 of 9 who took the credit without working is truly completely lost, often without realizing it, and is held up entirely by the work of other students. collaboration means to work together, not to blindly take someone elses work or to give your own work away. my advice to someone who feels that his/her partner did not contribute fairly (or at all) to an assignment is: do not partner with them again! you also have the option to let me know about the situation and i will remind the errant partner about his/her responsibilities. there will be no consequences the first time this happens, but if i hear of this person being a lazy partner again, then i will likely penalize his/her grade. the bottom line is: the instructor will try to be very specific about what kinds of collaboration are permitted, and what kinds of collaboration are not permitted, and are considered a form of academic dishonesty. if you are not sure about whether some kind of collaboration is permitted or not, or if dishonesty is taking place, then it is your responsibility to ask questions. exams (65%) both the midterm exam (worth 30%) and the final exam (worth 35%) are closed book. the final exam is cumulative. for both exams, you are permitted to bring a copy of a mips reference card (theres a pdf of it on our class website). late policy and make up policy  please read! a late submission means submitting 24 hours after a deadline. late submissions will result in a 20% penalty. anything submitted beyond the deadline + 24 hours will receive a zero. no makeup is allowed for assignments except in rare cases, if there is a documented family emergency, documented extended illness, documented required court appearance, or other situation beyond the studentsontrol (again, with documentation) the instructor may grant additional make up days entirely at the instructordiscretionbut this is not a guarantee or a right. asking for accommodation because i already bought my plane ticket or i have out of town guests that week is a useless exercise and will not work for you. there is no makeup for any exam. the midterm and the final exam dates are announced in this syllabus and are fixed. if you believe you cannot attend any of these dates realize you risk receiving an f grade. if you believe that a grade on an assignment or a midterm exam is wrong, you may ask for a review for a possible re-grade. in that case, you have to arrange a meeting with your t.a. within 1 week from when the grade was issued (in other words, we will ignore requests for re-grade at some point after that). please have a good reason to ask for a re-grade and understand that it is not a guarantee of a grade change. ucsb and instructors policies on academic integrity and honesty academic integrity it is expected that students attending the university of california understand and subscribe to the ideal of academic integrity, and are willing to bear individual responsibility for their work. any work (written or otherwise) submitted to fulfill an academic requirement must represent a studentoriginal work. any act of academic dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, will subject a person to university disciplinary action. using or attempting to use materials, information, study aids, or commercial "research" services not authorized by the instructor of the course constitutes cheating. representing the words, ideas, or concepts of another person without appropriate attribution is plagiarism. whenever>>5
