final course grades class grades will be assigned based on performance on homework assignments, possible in-class assignments, points allotted for work in the lab sections (toward the team projects), and points for the final project product and demonstration. there will be a peer-evaluation component based on contributions to the team as well. to convert final averages to letter grades, a standard 10 point scale will be used, with the upper and lower ends of each range as +/- grades, except for a+ grades, see below. there is no rounding up; a grade of 86.9999 is a b and a grade of 87.0000 is a b+. a+ grades: these may be awarded to the very best performing students in the classbut the cutoff for a+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no pre-determined cutoffan average of 97 or more doesnt guarantee you an a+ grade.) the grade of a+ is based on my direct knowledge of your outstanding performance and participation as well as my ability to cite examples that illustrate how you went beyond the regular class expectations. such knowledge can be gained by having several conversations during office hours, any outstanding extra work, your independent projects that use course material, and/or helpful and informed participation in class or on the forum, just to name a few examples. grade item percentage of final grade hwks, in class assignments 25% project grade (labs) 25% project grade (final product) 40% team work component (assessed through peer evals) up to 10% missing homework/in-class activities: drop the lowest two if you miss a class or the submission of any of the above deliverables, you miss the opportunity for the points on that deliverable that was due. there is no makeup. in lieu of providing a makeup opportunity, we will drop the lowest homework/in-class-assignment grades (which may be zeros if you miss an assignment.)>>5

project points information about project grading will be discussed in a separate document and released during week 2. late labs the policy is simple, and is based on the idea that the primary purpose of the deadlines is to allow you as well as the ta to manage workload. to eliminate context switching between different labs:  if you want your work to be graded without penalty, turn it in on time.  if you turn in your lab late, you risk getting a zero.  we will grade late labs only if it creates no extra inconvenience for the graders, and we will impose a penalty between 10-20% (see the individual grading rubrics for the labs.)  there is no guarantee that late labs will be graded at all. the ta will simply start work at some point after the deadline, and grade until they are finished. at that time, we will close the books on that particular lab, and any work not submitted at that time will not be considered. attendance this course is, to a large extent, about process, including the process by which individuals work together on a team. our class meeting times are the only scheduled times our teams definitely come together to meet. so it is essential that you are here. if you absolutely have to miss class, please get notes from your classmates, check edstem notes to see what you missed, and come to the student support hours to work through any material thats not clear. questions about grades summary: homework regrade requests must be made only on gradescope, and always within one week.>>5

from time to time, we may make clerical errors in grading (e.g. adding up points wrong or applying a rubric incorrectly.) for this reason, you are encouraged to review your grades as soon as they are posted to gradescope and canvas. you will typically get an email as soon as each grade is posted. from the time the grade is posted, you will have one calendar week to submit regrade requests. requests on homework regrading must be made only through gradescope, on the correct problem. (dont request a regrade for question 4 on the page for question 7.) please note that regrade requests based on clerical errors or applying a rubric incorrectly are always welcome. over the course of the quarter, well grade thousands of individual problems, so it is unlikely that we wont make at least some mistakes. more problematic are challenges to the rubric itself, e.g. i dont think you should have taken off so many points for that error or i think i deserve more partial credit for that incorrect answer. the instructor and ta will always listen, but please know that weve put a great deal of thought, time and experience into determining the rubric, and weve done our best to apply it to all students equitably. you may have a different point of view, we will not always agree with your assessmentin fact, we seldom will. as such, regrade requests on this basis are not encouraged. it is important to approach such conversations in a respectful manner, accepting that the instructor, ta and grader have been given responsibility for determining course standards, and applying those in a fair way to all students. communication for all course-related questions, please use the discussions tab on edstem. you can also post there anonymously to your classmates. direct emails are discouraged and might not even be seen if cs148 is not in the subject. note that we will always use only the official course platforms to reach out to you: posts on edstem, canvas, and ucsb email. if anyone contacts you through an unofficial channel claiming to be a mentor/instructor, offering to help you or to debug your code, please, do not interact with them and immediately send a message via discussions to the staff. accommodations for disabilities students with disabilities may request academic accommodations for exams online through the ucsb disabled students program at http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/. please make>>5
