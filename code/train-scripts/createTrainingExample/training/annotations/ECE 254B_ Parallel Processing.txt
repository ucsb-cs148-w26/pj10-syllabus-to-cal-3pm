 consultation: open office hours, held in room 5155 engineering i  m 11:30-1:00, w 3:30-5:00 motivation: the ultimate efficiency in parallel systems is to achieve a computation speedup factor of p with p processors. although often this ideal cannot be achieved, some speedup is generally possible by using multiple processors in a concurrent (parallel or distributed) system. the actual speed gain depends on the systems architecture and the algorithm run on it. this course focuses on the interplay of architectural and algorithmic speedup techniques. more specifically, the problem of algorithm design for general-purpose parallel systems and its converse, the incorporation of architectural features to help improve algorithm efficiency and, in the extreme, the design of algorithm-based special-purpose parallel architectures, are dealt with. the foregoing notions will be covered in sufficient detail to allow extensions and applications in a variety of contexts, from network processors, through desktop computers, game boxes, web server farms, multiterabyte storage systems, and mainframes, to high-end supercomputers. prerequisite: basic computer architecture at the level of ece 154; an advanced architecture course, such as ece 254a, would be helpful but can be waived. references: required textparhami, b., intro. parallel processing: algorithms and architectures, plenum, 1999. click on the title to view detailed information about the textbook, its errata, and downloadable powerpoint presentations used in course lectures. supplement 1, optional  dally, w.j. and b.p. towles, interconnection networks: principles and practices, morgan kaufmann, 2004. get more info via www.mkp.com (search for the title). supplement 2, optional  because the focus of this course is on architecture and its interplay with algorithms, sourcebook of parallel computing (ed. by j. dongarra et al, morgan kaufmann, 2003), which deals primarily with software and application topics, constitutes helpful supplementary reading. get more info via www.mkp.com (search for the title). journals  ieee trans. computers, ieee trans. parallel and distributed systems, j. parallel & distributed computing, parallel computing, parallel processing letters. also, ieee computer and ieee concurrency (the latter ceased publication in late 2000) for broad introductory papers. conferences  intl symp. computer architecture (isca, since 1973), intl conf. parallel processing (icpp, since 1972), intl parallel & distributed processing symp.

25% -- homework: see the deadlines column in course calendar for schedule.  25% -- closed-book midterm exam: see the course calendar for date and coverage.  50% -- research project participation and report: see the description below. research: the class will cooperate in investigating a well-defined problem relating to interconnection networks for parallel processing. a brief period in some class sessions will be devoted to defining the research problem, dividing up the work, reviewing the progress, and setting research goals. please follow the research paper guidelines to format your research report. students who obtain results of publishable quality will receive an "a" for the course, regardless of homework and midterm exam grades. calendar: course lectures, homework assignments, and exams have been scheduled as follows. this schedule will be strictly observed. textbook chapters are specified for lectures and exams. it is a good idea to look over the covered chapter(s) before each lecture if possible.  day & date chap lecture topic deadlines, links, notes>>5

b. show that the 21-node 2d multigrid with a 44 base can be embedded in a 5-cube with dilation 2 and congestion 1 but that the 21-node pyramid cannot. 14.c hypercube routing algorithm consider a q-cube in which each bidirectional link has been replaced by two unidirectional links in opposite directions. dividing the unidirectional links into upward links (connecting x to y with x < y) and downward links (connecting x to y with x > y), we can view the hypercube as two unidirectional cubes formed by the upward and downward links. a proposed routing algorithm works as follows. the route taken by a message going from node u to node w passes through an intermediate node v such that the path from u to v in the upward cube and the path from v to w is in the downward cube (v can be the same as u or w). a. show that the proposed algorithm always chooses a shortest path from u to w. b. prove that the algorithm is free from deadlock if used for wormhole routing. c. how can we benefit from this algorithm in devising a deadlock-free routing algorithm for a bidirectional hypercube? ece 254b s2006>>1
