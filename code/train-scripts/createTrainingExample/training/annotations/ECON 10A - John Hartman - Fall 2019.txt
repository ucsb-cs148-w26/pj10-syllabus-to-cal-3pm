course material: the required textbook for the course is intermediate microeconomics with calculus, custom edition 1st edition, by hal r. varian, w. norton & company, available in the ucsb bookstore. (you can also buy the regular edition.) the workbook associated with the textbook is optional, but not required. there are many other textbooks that could be helpful as (optional) supplements, the most widely used of which is microeconomic theory: basic principles and extensions by walter nicholson. midterms and final: midterm 1, thursday, october 17   midterm 2, thursday, november 14   final exam, friday, december 7, 7:30  10:30 pm time block your grade will be a weighted average of your performance on midterm 1 (25%), midterm 2 (25%), and the final exam (50%). the rst midterm will only test material covered until then, and the second midterm will focus on the material taught after the rst midterm, but will include earlier material as well. the nal exam will cover material from the entire quarter. for each midterm and the nal exam, you will need a full page pink scantron: parscore f-1712-par-l. the nal exam location will be announced once we have a scheduled room from the registrars ofce. for midterms, you must show up and be seated by the beginning of the lecture time. we will assign homework regularly. it is important that you attempt to do the assigned problems, and that you do so before you see the solutions. you do not need to turn in the homework problems. the catch is that answers to these problems will not be posted on the web. the only way to obtain answers for homework is to see the problems worked out in section and ta ofce hours. your percentage grade at the end of the term will be converted into a letter grade as follows: a  87.0%-100.0% a-  82.0%-86.9% b+  77.0%-81.9% b  72.0%-76.9% b-  65.0%-71.9% c+  58.0%-64.9% c  50.0%-57.9% c-  40.0%-49.9% d  30.0%-39.9% f  0.0%-29.9% all posted grades are nal unless there is an administrative or grading error. succeeding in the course: doing well in this course requires you to not only attend lectures and section, but to practice solving problems. problem sets will be available on the econ 10a gauchospace page. there are two types of problem sets: one set that tas will work through in section and no answers will be provided on gauchospace and a second extra set of problems that will have answers posted on gauchospace. administrative issues: the economics department ofces handle all administrative matters related to dropping or adding the course, wait lists, etc. please contact them regarding these issues. you are expected to take both midterms and the nal exam as scheduled. once a student begins a test, that test will count as part of the students grade. if you miss a midterm because of sickness or some other legitimate reason, send your instructor an email before the midterm explaining your absence. if your explanation is accepted as legitimate, the midterm missed will not be counted as part of your grade and the nal exam will be worth an additional 25% of your grade. we do not give midterms or nals at any time except when scheduled. if you believe that you will not be able to make the nal exam as it is scheduled, you will need to contact your instructor as soon as you know and ask if an incomplete petition can be granted. if you have another class with a nal exam scheduled at the same day and time as the econ 10a nal, you need to e-mail and verbally tell your instructor of the conict no later than 1 week after midterm 1. if you do not notify your instructor by this date, you will need to complete your nal exam as scheduled. if you believe a midterm has not been properly graded, you must submit a (hard copy) type-written re-grade>>5

request to an instructor with your original, unaltered solutions no later than the fourth lecture after exams are rst passed back in section. (exception: if there are less than 4 lectures remaining after the second midterm is handed back in section for the rst time, you will also need to get your re-grade request to your instructor by the end of the last lecture.) you must explain clearly why you believe your score is in error. any students participating in the disabled students program (dsp) must make the appropriate arrangements with the dsp ofce as necessary. any requests made to dsp without sufcient time to make the appropriate arrangements will lead to the student being tested under the same time and room conditions as other students in the class. dsp students are urged to meet with their instructors during ofce hours before midterm 1 in order to prevent any confusion about the test-taking parameters. it is the students responsibility to make sure that he/she knows how much time will be available for her/his test, even if it differs from the accommodation set up through dsp. academic integrity: you may work with other students on problem sets. on midterms and the nal exam, the standard rules apply as outlined in academic integrity at ucsb: a students guide. on those exams, you are cheating if you copy from another student, allow another student to copy from you, consult notes or a textbook during the exam, have another student take an exam for you, or communicate with another student about answers to the exam. electronic devices of any kind (calculators, cell phones, computers, etc.) are not permitted. any student who cheats during an exam will receive an f for the course and/or the incident will be reported to the ofce of judicial affairs for further sanctions. possible sanctions include suspension and dismissal. the economics department has established a hotline at which you can anonymously report cheating incidents. the url is https://econ.ucsb.edu/cheating/ we also photocopy all open response answers of midterms. any re-grade request must include an unaltered copy of your open-response problems from test day. any changes made to your open-response sheet and subsequently submitted for a re-grade may be reported to the university as academic misconduct. email: econ 10a instructors and tas do not answer subject-related questions via email. please save these questions for ofce hours. email is best for small administrative questions. this syllabus is subject to change. any changes will be made in lecture and/or gauchospace with at least one week of notice, except under extraordinary circumstances. other important information may be given in lecture, which you are responsible for knowing. some students become distressed from the pressure of econ 10a. some good sources for help may include counseling & psychological services (http://caps.sa.ucsb.edu/). if you are looking for group study space, please check https://www.library.ucsb.edu/services/group-study. the schedule of lectures and sections begins on the next page. schedule of lecture topics (bold italic thursday lectures are in campbell hall) (bold italic thursday lectures are in campbell hall)>>1
