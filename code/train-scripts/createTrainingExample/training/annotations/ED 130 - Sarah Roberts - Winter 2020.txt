final project you and 1-2 partners will create a lesson plan to teach a particular topic in secondary mathematics. you will create a lesson plan that uses a problem- solving task that covers a particular standard or set of standards for the grade level (or grade band) you would like to teach where students would experiment with mathematical ideas. you cannot present a lecture for your lesson!!!! (your lesson should show what youve learned in the class.) your lesson plan must include:  the standards and applicable content for the lesson,  how students and the teacher would engage with the content, and  how you would facilitate student learning.  you must use the lesson plan template posted on gauchospace. part 1: planning o you will need to meet with dr. roberts by 2/10 to review your plan (bring a brainstorm of your ideas with you to this meeting that provides an overview of what you will be doing.) o you will focus on providing a tool for learning the content (one that others might later use in their own class)  highlighting not only the content but also a particular pedagogical tool or exercise (you will not be lecturing on the topic!!). for example, you might show how to use a measurement tool, set of stations, a desmos lesson, etc. the possibilities are endless! part 2: executing (present to another group, or several assigned) sign-up for a room in the ggse with veronica munoz (veronicamunoz@ucsb.edu). tell her day, time, how many people, and if you need a whiteboard, etc.  you will plan for your activity to take approximately 20-30 minutes: o share your lesson plan and associated handouts. o lead the activity for 20 minutes  setting the stage for how old the students are, what their prior knowledge would be, and what youd expect in this lesson. videotape the presentation of your lesson. o you should provide 3-5 questions to lead a discussion with your partner group  linked to particular questions and concerns you may have had about your lesson and to spur conversation linked to prior work we have done in the class. your peers will also provide you with oral feedback during this time. take notes during this time  you should include this in your part 3! part 3: reflecting (complete individually) o write a 2-3 page double-spaced reflection of your preparation and implementation/execution of your peer-teaching event.  select a 2-3 minute clip from your lesson presentation (and include it with your reflection  on youtube video, googledrive, dropbox, box, etc.). o within your 2-3 page reflection:  first, write 1-2 paragraphs about what you learned overall in this process (the whole process from start to finish across the quarter)  what do you feel like youve learned and/or gained through completing this task, what youd do differently next time, etc..  then, analyze your video clip. describe why youve selected it, what it shows about what youve learned about teaching mathematics, and how you might teach in the future as a result.  finally, 1-2 paragraphs about how you see this affecting your future work and where you are headed next.>>5
