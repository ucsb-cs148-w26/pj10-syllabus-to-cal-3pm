attendance (and the i>clicker): attendance at all lectures is required and will be taken throughout each class via i>clicker, beginning on the rst day of the rst week of class. thus, you need to have an i>clicker device or app by this date. you need to register your i>clicker on gauchospace as soon as possible. if it is not registered, your attendance will nonetheless be noted and saved to the system, but there will be no way of connecting if with your perm. if you register it late, previous attendances will be recorded. attendance accounts for 30% of the total course grade. since there are 30 lectures (minus holidays), each unexcused absence reduces the course grade by 1%. hence, just showing up for class is the easiest thing that you can do to help your grade. note that i>clicker polling will take place near the beginning, during, and near the end of every class. if a student is found to be in possession of another students i>clicker during polling, the devices will be conscated and both students will be reported to ucsbs ofce of judicial affairs as an incident of academic dishonesty (i.e. attempting to alter the course grade by 1%). please note that both students can be charged for academic dishonesty. hence, this is not something that you want to ask a friend to do (or agree to do for a friend). please note: 1) if you forgot your i>clicker, or for some reason it is not working properly, you need to see your ta before you leave the lecture hall. 2) within 24 hour of the end of lecture, attendance will generally be posted to gauchospace. you are required to conrm your own attendance. if you attended class but it is not showing up on gauchospace, you need to immediately email your ta (all attendance is handled by the course tas, not ken). 3) regarding #1 & #2, you need to have contacted your ta regarding an unrecorded attendance by midnight of the day after the lecture (assuming that attendance is posted to gauchospace). no exceptions will be made to this rule.>>5
weekly film assignments each week you are required to watch that weeks lm and comment on it.>>1
watching and commenting on all lms is a requirement of the course and constitutes 10% of the total course grade (i.e. each lm & corresponding comment is worth 1% of the course grade). note that in previous years watching the course lms was optional. this is no longer the case. watching and commenting on each and every lm is a requirement of the course. all videos stream directly from gauchospace (gauchocast) or youtube and can be viewed on computers and mobile devices. once you watch a lm, you are required to comment on it. a comment should be as long as necessary to make your point(s). a paragraph or two is generally sufcient. please make specic references to the lm in order to make clear that you have watched the entire lm (and not just a portion or a trailer). the purpose of this>>5

assignment is to expose you to a range of thought-provoking material. consequently, your comment should contain your thoughts on the lm. once you make a comment on gauchospace, you will then be able to see what your classmates have written. (in the case of youtube, you will, of course, be able to read all posted comments before making yours.) you are not required to read what others think, but you are encouraged to do so. reading through them can itself be a thought-provoking experience, as it can give you the opportunity to see how others reacted to the lm and its ideas. this might also help you assess your own work, as you can see how much time and thought that your classmates are giving to the assignment. all lm assignments will appear on gauchospace: 1) in the case of the lms on gauchospace (gauchocast), it will be possible to comment directly on the weekly prompt on gauchospace. 2) in the case of lms on youtube, please comment directly on youtube, as it will not be possible to comment on the gauchospace prompt. important: please cut and paste all of your comments (both from gauchospace and youtube) into a single text le. make sure that you include the header material (i.e. the true cost, by___________- friday, october 10, 2019, 3:05 pm). 1) prior to the midterm, your ta will send you login info for a google drive folder. please upload a pdf of your above mentioned le with the comments for the rst ve lms by midnight, monday, nov 4. 2) prior to the final exam, your ta will again send you login info for a google drive folder. please upload a pdf of your above mentioned le with the comments for the last ve lms by midnight, friday, december 6. your ta will provide more information on the above as we get closer to these deadlines.>>5
