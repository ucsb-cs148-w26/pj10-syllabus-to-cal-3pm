final paper guidelines (optional: this will replace the final exam) your paper will be done in three steps. the 200-word paper proposal with title and reference list is due to dr. clark via an email attachment as either .doc or .docx file on april 27 by 5:00 pm. please begin your file title with your last name. the first draft of a submittable paper is due as an email attachment on may 11. these will be peer reviewed by a classmate. email peer review comments to dr. clark before 5 pm on may 22. you will then revise your text taking into account the peer review and email it to dr. clark before noon on june 12. keep in mind the submittable draft (15%), peer review (10%), and final draft (10%) combine to make up 35% of your grade so spend the time getting it done right and on time. work turned in late will be accepted but there will be a  letter grade reduction per day. please use the following format for your file name: last_name 168.doc or last_name 168.docx. i would use clark 168.docx. paper guidelines: 1. discuss a problem. 2. use primary references (i.e., journal articles). textbooks, newspaper articles, and most web sites are not primary references. 3. use the reference format discussed below. 4. make it about 2,000 to 3,000 words of text (double spaced, 12-point font) and no more than 3,500 words. 5. include page numbers. 6. include 2-3 relevant figures or tables. write your own figure captions/table headings that includes its source. 7. cite at least 3 primary references. 8. write an abstract 9. include a title 10. break the text into the following parts: introduction, discussion (you may include a short implication section at the end of the discussion but this is not required), summary, and references (list references in alphabetically order and do not use footnotes). 11. do not write an op-ed or advocacy/opinion piece 12. write a scientific review paper. 13. scientific review papers do not quote sources; they paraphrase source and add citations to the text. 14. write in the passive voice. 15. attribute ideas, data, and figures to proper sources. 16. do your own work. sub-divid your paper into four parts: abstract, introduction, discussion, and summary introduction guidelines: your introduction must communicate several things in a relatively brief amount of space:  the question that your paper will help answer or discuss.  why this question is important.>>5

relevant background on the research (what the reader needs to know in order to understand the paper) the introduction should be at least two paragraphs. peer review for the peer review, you will read the text of one of your fellow students and provide comments in two ways 1) comments with suggestions about the overall content and structure (e.g., organization, clarity, flow) and 2) editorial marks (e.g., pointing out misspellings, rewording suggestions). please use the review/track change tool in word (remember to turn on track change). some tips:  always point out strengths as well as elements that need more work  be specific. point to particular places in the paper where revision will be helpful  dont hesitate to respond as a reader, pointing out where you got confused or where a good argument was made.  make comments in the spirit of helpfulness. take comments in the spirit of helpfulness. paper citation format within the text, please use the following format: for a single authored publication: last_name (year) or (last_name, year) for a publication with two authors: last_name1 and last-name2 (year) or (last_name1 and last-name2, year) for a publication with three of more authors: last_name1 et al. (year) or (last_name1 et al., year) at the end of the text use the following format for the reference list: for a single authored publication*: last_name, f. m. (year) paper title, journal name, vol, pp-pp. for a publication with two authors: last_name, f. m. and f. m. last_name2 (year) paper title, journal name, vol, pp-pp. for a publication with three of more authors (include all authors): last_name, f. m., f. m. last_name2, f. m. last_name3, , and f. m. last_namen** (year) paper title, journal name, vol, pp-pp.>>5

references need to be listed in alphabetical order of the first author. if an author or a set of authors is referenced two or more time, insert a, b, c, etc. immediate after the year based on the order in which the papers are cited in the text. *f = first name initial; m = middle name initial; last_name includes jr., iii, etc. **last_namen = the final author of a paper with more than 3 authors. for example, the reference for benson et al. (2014) paper i wrote with a former graduate and undergraduate students, should be: benson, a, m. zane, t. e. becker, a. visser, s. h. uristegui, e. derubeis, j. e. moran, b. k. esser, and j. f. clark (2014) quantifying reaeration rates in alpine streams using deliberate gas tracer experiments. water, 6, 1013-1027.>>5
