(example at the 4th absence, the attendance grade will drop from an a to an a-; with the 5th absence the grade will drop from an a- to a b+). active class participation in also crucial. students are expected to come to class prepared and participate in all activities. students are expected to actively participate in class activities with both the instructors and in pairs/groups. the instructor will rate the students participation by his/her involvement in activities assigned as well as by the students attention given to class time. having your computer/tablet open or using your phone during class time does not grant you a high score on participation if you are using it for non-class related activities. on the contrary, it constitutes a clear sign that you are dis-engaged and not participating. homework  10% homework will be assigned daily with some exercises corrected in class. your instructor will periodically assign homework to be turned in. all ilrn assignments and daily lesson plans are posted on gauchopspace where you can find missed material and assignments. it is your responsibility to get material and/or homework for classes that you missed. do not ask me for missed assignments via e- mail. homework will need to be completed online -- on ilrn --, and submitted it by the deadline specified by your instructor. if you complete the assignment after the due date, the system will not accept your submission and that will affect the homework portion of your grade.>>5
