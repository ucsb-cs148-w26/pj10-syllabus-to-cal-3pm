canvas site: https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/26222 course description this class introduces students to formal techniques for evaluating arguments. we cover a natural deduction system of sentential logic, truth-tables, a natural deduction system of first-order predicate logic, and the basic ideas of model theory. the application of these systems for analyzing arguments is discussed. exams are designed to test skill with the formal systems, particularly translation from english to formulas, proof techniques, and methods for showing invalidity. there are no prerequisites for the course. learning objectives by the end of the course, you should be competent with the formal methods introduced from chapter 1 through to chapter 6, section 2 of the textbook. if you have mastered these concepts you will be well-positioned to appreciate the significance of formal logic as a benchmark for argumentative rigor in fields as diverse as philosophy, law, mathematics, and science. you will also be in a position to understand the foundational role of logic for technological developments in computing hardware and software design. textbook and website the textbook for the course is logic primer, 3rd edition by colin allen and michael hand. pdfs of each chapter are provided to you for your personal use via canvas. printed copies of the book are available from various online book vendors including the publisher mit press. the current printing of the 3rd edition contains some typographical errors. a webpage with the list of errata and pdfs of fixed pages is available at https://logic.tamu.edu/errata3.html . the pdf version in canvas has all these fixed, but let your instructor know if you find others. there is also a website where you may practice the techniques and test yourself with exercises from the book. it is freely available at https://logic.tamu.edu/. using this website for your homework practice will greatly improve your chance of success in the course. a second website justinfer written by ucsb graduate student morgan davies also supports the system of logic we will be using. go to settings and choose one of the logic primer options grading basis grades will be assigned on the basis of two midterms (during regular class each), final exam, and in-class quizzes. the quizzes are for extra credit and unless otherwise stated at the top of the quiz sheet, your response to the quiz questions must be perfect to receive credit (i.e., there will be no partial credit on quizzes). quiz answers can be turned in immediately for double credit or taken home and turned in at the beginning of the next class meeting for regular credit. full regular credit will convert to a 4% boost for the course. double credit can therefore be as high 8%, or nearly a full letter grade. your overall score will be computed using three methods and you will be assigned a grade based on the best of these methods. 1. two midterms worth 100 points each + final worth 200 points; + extra credit from quizzes 2. two midterms scaled to 200 points each + extra credit from quizzes 3. final scaled to 400 points; no extra credit. your best score out of 400 will be converted to a percentage and then a letter grade for the course according to the following scale: [100+:a+] [95-99:a] [90-94:a-] [87-89:b+] [84-86:b] [80-83:b-] [77-79:c+] [74-76:c] [70-73:c-] [65-79:d+] [60-64:d] [0-59:f] implications of this grading scheme: if you are satisfied with your grade after midterms you won't need to take the final. if you have done poorly on earlier exams, you can still pull everything out on the comprehensive final exam. bring your own paper for quizzes and exams. (blue books not required.) midterms and finals will be open book and notes--but not open neighbor! midterm dates will be confirmed with 7 days notice. numerical scores on midterms and finals will not be curved. make up 1/31/26, 4:51 pm phil 183/283g - spring 2025 - beginning modern logic https://colinallen.dnsalias.org/courses/2024-2025_spring/logic/ 1/4>>5

tests will be provided only in cases of authorized absence. see below for policy on in-class quizzes. course format, assessments, and attendance attendance will not be formally monitored but quiz credit is available only for those attending class. because all quizzes are for extra credit, no make-ups will be provided, although if you miss class you may obtain the quiz from a classmate and turn it in at the beginning of the next meeting (usually the discussion section). homework and schedule of readings and exams the schedule shown is tentative. it is a good idea to read a section or two ahead of wherever we are in the class at that moment. the pace is high and it will be important for you to stay on track with the homework (ungraded) and quizzes (graded). homework consists of all the exercises in the book. the "quizmaster" section of the website at logic.tamu.edu contains the bookexercises as well as additional practice exercises. date topic readings / assignments week 1>>5

except in logic (phil 183), you may find my concise guides to reading philosophy and writing philosophy helpful. you may find them useful even if you are not so new to philosophy. classwork expectations undergraduate full time load at ucsb is a minimum of 12 units and an average of 15 units. based on a 40-hour work week, this comes out to between 2.7 and 3.3 hours per credit hour per week. thus, in a 3 unit course you should be spending roughly 9 hours per week on the course, and for a 4 unit course, it would be 12 hours. if your course meets for 75 minutes twice a week, that's 2.5 hrs of contact time leaving 6 to 9 hours per week of outside lecture time. if you have a discussion section, then one hour is allocated there and these numbers drop to 5 and 8. in other words, you should be spending roughly 2 hours outside class on readings and assignments for every hour in class. notetaking and studying concerning note-taking and studying styles, you are advised to read the following two articles from the cognitive science of learning. 1. mueller & oppenheimer 2014 the pen is mightier than the keyboard 2. karpicke & roediger 2006 test-enhanced learning 3. kosmyna et al. 2025 your brain on chatgpt: accumulation of cognitive debt when using an ai assistant for essay writing task tldr: (1) taking notes on a keyboard is less effective than taking notes by hand; (2) practicing recall via repeated testing is more effective than re-reading for long term retention; (3) using llms to write essays has negative cognitive and neural consequences. missed assignments except when indicated in the main part of the syllabus above, you may request to make up for missed exams or other assignments for and only for university-recognized officially excused absences: for predictable absences due to competitive events, required activities in other classes, etc., documentation must be provided at least two weeks prior to the absence. ucsb is committed to providing reasonable academic accommodations to allow students observances of their religious beliefs. whenever possible, students will be given reasonable time to make up any academic assignment that is missed due to participation in a religious observance. it is your responsibility to inform me as soon as possible of any intended absences for religious observances, no less than two weeks in advance. for genuine emergencies, illnesses, or deaths in the family, written documentation must be provided when you return to class. statement about academic misconduct students in this course are obliged to comply with ucsb's academic integrity policies. any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the quarter will be referred via the academic integrity procedures detailed at the above link. when you submit assignments with your name on them in this course, you are signifying that the work contained therein is all yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. if you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand. use of chatgpt or similar generative ai products will be discussed in prior to any writing assigments, and may not be used unless you are explicitly given permission to do so, and never without explicit acknowledgment of its use. diversity and inclusion the americans with disabilities act (ada) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. if you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both your instructor and ucsb's disabled students program for information about accomodations and services. the university of california, in accordance with applicable federal and state laws and university policy, prohibits discrimination against or harassment of any person at the university on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition (cancer-related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, or age. for more information see https://eodp.ucsb.edu/resources/policies. i ask that everyone in the class strive to help ensure that other members of this class can learn in a supportive and respectful environment. if there are instances of the aforementioned issues, you may contact the title ix office, by calling 805-893-2701 or visiting https://titleix.ucsb.edu/. you may also choose to report this to a faculty/staff member; they may also be required to communicate about such issues to the universitys office of diversity and incusion. if you wish to maintain complete confidentiality, you may also contact university counseling & psychological services . statement on classroom recording to ensure the free and open discussion of ideas, students may not record classroom lectures, discussion and/or activities without the advance written permission of the instructor, and any such recording properly approved in advance can be used solely for the students own private use. 1/31/26, 4:51 pm phil 183/283g - spring 2025 - beginning modern logic https://colinallen.dnsalias.org/courses/2024-2025_spring/logic/ 3/4 IRRELEVANT
