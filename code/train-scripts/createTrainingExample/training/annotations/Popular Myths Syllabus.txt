you will then be responsible for keeping track of when you are scheduled to post a question  i will not remind you. characteristics of good questions:  your question must be posted by 9:00 am the day before class. in other words, if your question is going to be discussed on tuesday, september 10, you must post your question to blackboard by monday, september 9th at 9:00 am.  your question must incorporate or address the material in at least one of the assigned readings for that class (preferably all two or three readings if there are multiple readings). your question should illustrate that youve done the reading and should require your fellow classmates to have done the reading.  your question should encourage your classmates to reflect upon and explain some of their own experiences, thoughts, and observations. the sample questions that i post for the first two classes will serve as models.  you need to answer your own question. ideally, your answer should be posted with your question by the 9:00 am deadline, but as long as you post the question at 9:00 am and post your own answer by 10:00 am, no points will be deducted. your question and answer will be worth 5% of your final grade and will be graded on a 10-point scale. i will provide your grade and feedback on your question personally via an email message. if you forget to post your question, you will receive a 0 on this assignment. if you post your question late, you will be penalized 10% for every hour that the question is late. your classmates cannot complete their part of the assignment until you post your question, so it must be posted promptly. b. answering other peoples questions (10%). in addition to posting and answering your own question, you will participate in the on-line discussion by posting answers to 10 of the questions asked by the instructor or by other students. characteristics of good answers:  your answer to someone elses question must be posted by 9:00 am the day of class. in other words, youll have 24 hours between the time a question is posted and when you can successfully answer it. i will print out the discussion contributions at 9:00 each class day and any contributions that are not in the pile will not be counted for a grade.  you should do the reading before you answer the question, and your answer to someone elses question should illustrate that youve done the reading.  your answer should include some of your own experiences, thoughts, and observations. the sample answers that i post for the first two classes will serve as models. you are welcome to include things that youve seen on tv or in movies, something that youve read in books, or a conversation that youve heard that suggest that a belief is alive and well in popular culture.  your answer should be respectful of other people in the class and their experiences and beliefs. please note that there will not be a question posted every day. i will post 2 questions and your 14 classmates will each post a question so there will be a total of 16 questions posted (in addition to the question that you post yourself). you may answer whichever questions you wish, but you must answer 10 questions by the end of the semester. start contributing early in the semester - if you assume that youll answer 10 questions on the last 10 days of class, youll be deeply disappointed because there may only be questions posted for 4 or 5 of those classes. you will not be able to make-up questions because the purpose of answering these questions is to contribute to the discussion in real-time.>>5

ratings / grading of blackboard discussion answers  answers will be rated and graded on a satisfactory / unsatisfactory basis. number rating satisfactory / unsatisfactory interpretation of number rating credit towards your grade 3 satisfactory exemplary answer! this rating will be reserved for truly outstanding responses to the questions posed. this rating does not earn more points than a rating of (2) but it gives me a way to let you know that your answer goes above and beyond what i expect. each satisfactory answer earns 1% toward your final grade. ten satisfactory answers earn you 10% of your final grade. 2 satisfactory good answer! you will receive this rating if you adequately meet all of the criteria for a good answer listed above. this will probably be the typical rating that you receive. same as above. 1 unsatisfactory your answer is unsatisfactory because it fails to meet one of the criteria. the answer you provided probably has one of the following problems and i will indicate what the problem is in my email:  too short  does not respond to the question  too superficial/vague, needs more detail  needs to demonstrate that youve read the current reading assignment  disrespectful of another person or group of persons you will not receive credit for your unsatisfactory answer. you will not be penalized or lose points, but you must respond to an additional question on another day. it will be as though you did not answer that question. in other words, you need 10 satisfactory answers to receive the full 10% of your grade. summary of assessments assessment % of final grade due dates and scheduling exams>>5

percentage points to letter grade conversion with the exception of the answers that you post to other peoples blackboard questions (which are graded as satisfactory / unsatisfactory as explained above), the following conversion scale will be used for assigning letter grades: 93.4  100% a 90.0  93.3% a- 86.7  89.9% b+ 83.3  86.7% b 80.0  83.2% b- 76.7  79.9% c+ 73.3  76.7% c 70.0  73.2% c- 66.7  69.9% d+ 63.3  66.7% d 60.0  63.2% d- < 60% r (failing grade) as you may have already learned, the +/- system is only used in determining midterm grades. your final grade in the course will either be an a, b, c, d, or r as the plusses or minuses will be dropped in calculating the final grades. id be delighted if everyone in the course earned an a and i believe thats possible if you work hard, pay attention to the criteria for excellent work, and develop effective strategies for thinking, studying, discussing, and writing. important policies attendance: attending class is one of the best ways to gain the knowledge and develop the discussion and critical thinking skills that are important to your success and enjoyment of this course. i will also be explaining the standards for excellent work in class, so by attending class you will be able to ask me about these standards and potentially even influence them. for these reasons, it will be to your advantage to come to class on a regular basis. from my perspective and the perspective of your fellow classmates, it is important that everyone attends class because the discussion will include a wider range of perspectives and ideas. however, i know that sometimes you may get sick or have other reasons that you cannot attend class on a given day. to strike a compromise, i will take attendance on a daily basis and you will be allowed to miss 3 classes without penalty. however, for each class that you miss after the 3rd class, 5% will be deducted from your final grade in the course. in other words, if you have a 94% in the class based on your exam scores, homework and writing assignments, but you missed 4 classes over the semester, 5% will be deducted and you will receive an 89% in the class which is a b. food: because the class overlaps with lunchtime, i want to offer the opportunity for everyone to bring their lunches to class if they want to. so well try it for the first few classes and see if it works. however, eating in class can be distracting to your classmates and to the instructor. with that in mind, ill have two policies about bringing food to class. you are welcome to bring your lunch to class as long as:  you unwrap and eat your lunch quietly.  you purchase your lunch early enough that you arrive on time to class. if there is a problem with either of these issues, i will discuss it with you individually and if the problem does not resolve, you will be asked to eat prior to or after class. plagiarism: if you a) use someone elses phrases, paragraphs, or even their ideas written in your own words and b) fail to provide a reference, then you have plagiarized that persons work. there are two ways to ensure that you dont plagiarize: 1) present your own ideas, and 2) when you present someone elses ideas or phrases, give them credit by providing a reference. plagiarism is a serious problem across college campuses today and i will actively check your work to ensure that you have not taken credit for someone elses ideas and writing. if i discover that youve plagiarized, you will fail the assignment and i will report the incident to the dean of h&ss, to your advisor, and to the academic affairs office where it will go in your file, as specified by the procedures in the student handbook.>>5

cheating: cheating is also a serious problem and encompasses such behaviors as copying another students work, bringing materials into an exam that are not allowed (such as cheat or crib sheets, notes written on the brim of a baseball cap, etc.), fabricating the data that you collect when we conduct observational research, and a variety of other academically dishonest behaviors. as with plagiarism, if i discover that you have cheated, you will fail the assignment and i will report the incident to the dean of h&ss, to your advisor, and to the academic affairs office where it will go in your file, as specified by the procedures in the student handbook. if another student allows you to copy their work, the student who allows you to copy will fail that assignment as well. late work: each written assignment (such as homework or parts of your research project) is due at the noon on the day that the assignment is due. assignments may be handed in late, but 10% of the grade for that assignment will be deducted for each 24 hour period that an assignment is late. in other words, if the assignment is due on thursday, 10% of the points will be taken off if it is turned in between class on thursday and friday at noon. likewise, 20% of the points will be deducted if it is turned in between friday at noon and saturday at noon, etc. late work must be submitted as an email attachment.>>5
