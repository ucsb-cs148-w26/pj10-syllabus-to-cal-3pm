phone: 422-5482 office hrs: weds. 11-1:00 or by appointment e-mail: sdsears@usfca.edu for students with disabilities or special needs, please see us if there is anything we can do to help course description after he graduated from college and before he entered harvard law school, president barack obama worked for three years as a community organizer on chicago's south side. according to president obama: organizing begins with the premise that (1) the problems facing inner-city communities do not result from a lack of effective solutions, but from a lack of power to implement these solutions; (2) that the only way for communities to build viable long-term power is by organizing people and money around a common vision; and (3) that a viable organization can only be achieved if a broadly based indigenous leadership -- and not one or two charismatic leaders -- can knit together the diverse interests of their local institutions. in this course we will study, question, put into action, and reflect upon what president obama was talking about. through a combination of service-learning experiences in a community-based organization, readings that address activism and social change, and in-class reflection and discussion, this course brings together theory and practice to offer students an opportunity to learn how to become effective agents of change. during our seminar meetings, we will come to learn the theory and tactics of community organizing and thereby gain a stronger understanding of relations of power and tools to challenge such structures. a major component of this course is the mandatory service-learning. over the course of the semester, students will spend at least 20 hours working with the 8th grade students at demarillac academy in the tenderloin. the course culminates with student created social change projects that draw upon hip hop culture to facilitate social change in our local communities. learning outcomes upon completion of this course, students will be able to: demonstrate knowledge of how sociologists define, study, and analyze activism and social change through assigned readings, class discussion, papers and the social change project. understand the philosophical, political and practical issues involved in community organizing find, gather and interpret qualitative and quantitative information about communities and community organizations through papers and social action project. distinguish community organizing from other approaches to addressing problems in communities. examine the essential concepts of power  what it is, how it is used and how groups and communities expand and strengthen their political power through organizing  and consider how to apply this learning. draw upon their service with a community partner to draft a community action proposal that examines the interrelated causes and pose potential solutions to social problems. demonstrate an awareness of social and cultural issues, including considerations of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality via in-class discussion, papers and social action projects. develop a greater understanding of human agency and recognize the significance of their contribution to community via the service-learning, reflection portfolio and community projects. engage and assess their role as an active citizen through participation in community organizations and the social change project.>>5

sears fall 2011- spring 2012 page 8 service-learning at de marillac academy your service-learning activities are intended to put the universitys mission to serve the larger community into action. in this capacity you are expected to work with the 8th grade students at de marillac academy (dma) as well as act as a participant researcher, gathering data to help inform your understanding of the causes and consequences of social problems, activism, and social change. the primary goal of your service experience in the wider community is to bring to life activism such that, your practice will inform your ideas and your ideas will inform your practice. during the semester, you will be working with dmas 8th graders to develop a social change project that address key areas of concern in their lives. this project will draw upon hip hop culture as a tool or vehicle to promote progressive social change. the nature of your project or product is a direct result of your work with dma and reflects the needs of the 8th graders (as expressed by them), your learning, and creativity. we will integrate the service-learning experience with the course curriculum through such methods as directed readings, reflective writing, and group discussion. if you are unable to participate in the dma project due to scheduling conflicts, you must develop an on-campus social change project. the service-learning component of this course is mandatory. your grade in the course will reflect the fulfillment of your service-learning obligations as well as your integration of your experience with course material. failure to complete the fieldwork component may result in a failing grade for the course. the service-learning requires that you complete a minimum of 20 hours (approx 2 hours per week) of service with dma. while serving at the community based agency, you will be expected to act in a responsible manner. you must keep scheduled work hours and complete assigned duties. you also are expected to maintain good working relationships with supervisors and peers. conduct that is deemed unacceptable to the agency supervisor may result in you being dismissed from that placement. if this is a problem for you, you must see us as soon as possible. process for termination of a service-learning project if at any point during the semester your service-learning experience no longer meets the above criteria, you should approach me immediately to discuss options to improve the situation, and/or terminate the service-learning. if the service-learning experience must be terminated for any reason, i will work with the student to secure a new placement, as soon as possible. students should not, under any circumstances, remain in a service-learning organization in which their personal, physical or emotional health is jeopardized or harmed. required texts: there are 2 required texts for this course. 5. rubin, h. and i. rubin. 2008. community organizing and development. new york: pearson. 4th edition. 6. su, celina. 2009. streetwise for book smarts: grassroots organizing and education reform in the bronx. ithaca, ny: cornell university press. recommended: 1. pyles, loretta. 2009. progressive community organizing: a critical approach for a globalizing world. course requirements participation 100pts change project 600pts midterm exam 100pts reading journal entries 100pts tbx reflection paper 100pts there are several types of assignments you'll be asked to complete this semester. you cannot successfully complete this course without pursuing all of them. 1. participation (attendance, punctuality, & leading class discussion): 100pts my philosophy of the teaching/learning experience is an interactive one. this is your class. i expect each of you to contribute to this experience by coming to class prepared by having already read the required reading and through active discussion. this requires that you not only read the material, but that you also interact with the reading. in addition, each student will be responsible for leading at least one class discussion. a handout detailing the requirements will be available on blackboard.>>5
