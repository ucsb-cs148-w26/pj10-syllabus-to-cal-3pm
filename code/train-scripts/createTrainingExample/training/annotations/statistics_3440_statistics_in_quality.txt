2 course materials required textbook: principles of statistics for engineers and scientist, 5th edition, by william navidi. learning outcomes by the end of this course, students should successfully be able to:  select and construct appropriate display procedures to provide graphical summaries of the data.  use appropriate summary statistics to describe the distribution of data.  use appropriate statistical terminology to describe data and distributions.  use correct procedures for designing experiments and observational studies.  compute and interpret the probability of statistical events.  match common probability distributions with simple engineering data generating processes.  model engineering data based on large-sample normal distribution assumptions, and identify when such models are appropriate for given data,  use the central limit theorem as the foundation of statistical inference.  construct and interpret confidence intervals within the context of engineering problems.  conduct and interpret hypothesis tests.  build a simple linear regression model and perform diagnostic checks for bivariate data.  construct one-way analysis of variance model and identify and interpret the source of variations.  select appropriate statistical tools to monitor process quality.  compute and interpret capability indices.

3 how this online course works mode of delivery: the course will be 100% online and synchronously delivered using carmenzoom during a scheduled class time that is common to all regional campuses. all lectures are delivered in-person from one of the regional campuses, and synchronously broadcast to students from other regional campuses using carmenzoom. the instructor will hold weekly office hours via carmenzoom. the times are given above. students need to come to a regional campus examination center to take any exams in the course. the exam will be free for the osu students registered for this course. pace of online activities: this course has 100% synchronous content. students are expected to attend and participate in each lecture synchronously via carmenzoom. credit hours and work expectations: this is a 3 credit-hour course. according to ohio state bylaws on instruction (go.osu.edu/credithours), students should expect around 3 hours per week of time spent on direct instruction (instructor content and carmen activities, for example) in addition to 6 hours of homework (reading and assignment preparation, for example) to receive a grade of c average. attendance and participation requirements: research shows regular participation is one of the highest predictors of success. with that in mind, i have the following expectations for everyones participation:  participating in online activities for attendance: every lecture, you are expected to log in to carmenzoom to attend the class and participate in class discussion.  carmenzoom meetings and office hours: office hours will be scheduled in carmenzoom and will be optional. students who are not able make the office hours may request carmenzoom meeting with the instructor.
