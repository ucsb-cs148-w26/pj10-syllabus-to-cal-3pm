Hi all, I've uploaded the annotated slides for the past two lectures. Apologies for posting this late. I'll
ensure future annotated slides are posted right after the lecture.  - Nabeel
Hi all, The programming assignment (PA1) has been released on the W26 course page on Kattis. The
deadline for PA1 is Friday, Feb 13th 11:59PM.  I would strongly recommend starting early, particularly
because to get full credit your submissions need to pass ALL the test cases for both the problems. Please
find the instructions to register yourself on the course and other important notes and policies here: Kattis
Instructions.pdf (Week2 modules). If you have questions, please post on Piazza. - Nabeel
Hi all, PA0 is due tomorrow, Friday 01/23 11:59PM. I'm just sending out a reminder.  Although it's
ungraded, I would highly recommend submitting those problems for PA0. It will help you get familiarized
with Kattis. Things like how to read inputs, etc. would come in handy when you're solving the problems
for PA1.  - Nabeel

Course Overview and Prerequisites
In this course, you'll build on the strong foundation you've developed in CMPSC 16 and CMPSC 24,
where you learned about data structures and algorithms, and CMPSC 40, where you honed your proof-
writing skills. With these tools already in your arsenal, you'll expand your understanding by exploring
new data structures and algorithms, applying them to real-world problems, and strengthening your
ability to analyze and prove their correctness. This course is designed to enhance your problem-
solving and reasoning skills, preparing you for more advanced topics in computing and algorithm
design. 
Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Build on your knowledge of data structures by implementing and analyzing data structures like hash
tables, heaps, and balanced search trees, understanding their efficiency and real-world applications.
2. Apply algorithmic analysis techniques with confidence, using Big-O, Theta, and Omega notation to
evaluate performance and make informed decisions about data structure selection.
3. Leverage graph algorithms to solve complex problems, mastering BFS, DFS, topological sorting,
Dijkstra’s algorithm, and MST algorithms.
4. Build on your ability to analyze algorithms by using techniques like induction, amortized analysis, and
probabilistic reasoning to deepen your understanding of how and why algorithms work correctly and
efficiently.
5. Recognize and apply data structures in computing, understanding their critical role in designing
efficient algorithms and solving real-world software challenges.

The homework assignments are typically due every Tuesday (unless told otherwise) and have to be
submitted on Gradescope. You can only turn in your assignments on Gradescope, so we will not accept
nor grade assignments emailed to us. At the end of the quarter, I will drop the lowest homework
grade.
Your homework assignment will be given to you as a PDF document. You should submit your homework
as a PDF file on Gradescope. No format other than PDF will be accepted and graded.
Programming Assignments
The programming assignments will be administered and handed in using the online programming
platform Kattis (https://ucsb.kattis.com
 (https://ucsb.kattis.com) ). 
Exams
This course has a midterm exam and a final exam. Both will be in-person and in our classroom. Taking
both these exams is required to pass the course. There are NO make ups for missed exams.

A+ grades: These may be awarded to the very best performing students in the class—but the cutoff for
A+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no
predetermined cutoff---an average of 97 or more doesn't guarantee you an A+ grade.) 
F grades: If you miss your final exam, you will receive an F, regardless of your running score in
the class. If you feel that I or the TAs have made a mistake (like adding up a grade incorrectly), then you
should certainly bring that to my attention in an expedient fashion.
Please do NOT ask me to round up your final class grade at the end of the quarter. Please know that I
will not engage with you in these requests. If you have any questions about how grades are computed,
please feel free to ask, and I would be happy to explain further.
 
“Slip” days for Homework Assignments
You have a total of 3 “slip” days to use throughout the quarter for homework assignments. You
may use up to 2 slip days on any one homework. We will automatically apply the slip days if you
submit the homework late. After using 2 slip days (or if you run out of slip days) there will be a 20%
penalty for one day late. After that the homework will not be accepted.
Late submissions will not be accepted for Programming Assignments.
Make up Policy
No makeup is allowed for assignments except in rare cases, if there is a documented family emergency,
documented extended illness, documented required court appearance, or other situation beyond the
students' control (with documentation), then the professor may grant additional make up days entirely at
the instructor's discretion – but this is not a guarantee or a right.
Again: No makeup is allowed for missed exams whatsoever.
Regrade Requests
If you believe that a grade on a homework assignment is wrong, you may ask for a review for a possible
re-grade. For assignments, you have to place a request via Gradescope within 3 days from when the
grade was issued.
Assistance to Students
This class has teaching assistants (TAs) and undergraduate learning assistants (ULAs). The TAs will
lead labs and hold office hours. The ULAs will also be holding office hours and helping you during labs.

You can also pose questions and answer each other’s questions on Piazza. Please do not use Piazza to
post outright solutions to homework or lab problems – you can, of course, discuss the exercises and
ways to solve the problems.
If you have questions that you’d rather email us with (for example, those of a personal nature), then
PLEASE put “CS130A” in the subject line.
Note to Students with Disabilities
Please register your accommodation requests with DSP at your very earliest opportunity – this is best
done by the first or second week of the quarter. Make sure that you submit your DSP request no later
than one week before a scheduled exam. The instructor will accommodate students only according to
information gotten from the DSP office. 
UCSB and Instructor’s Policies on Academic Integrity
and Honesty
Academic Integrity
It is expected that students attending the University of California understand and subscribe to the ideal of
academic integrity, and are willing to bear individual responsibility for their work. Any work (written or
otherwise) submitted to fulfill an academic requirement must represent a student's original work. Any act
of academic dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, will subject a person to University
disciplinary action. Using or attempting to use materials, information, study aids, or commercial
"research" services not authorized by the instructor of the course constitutes cheating. Representing the
words, ideas, or concepts of another person (or copied from an LLM like “ChatGPT”) without appropriate
attribution is plagiarism. Whenever another person's written work is utilized, whether it be a single
phrase or longer, quotation marks must be used and sources cited. Paraphrasing another's work, i.e.,
borrowing the ideas or concepts and putting them into one's "own" words, must also be acknowledged.
I will report the violation to the Associate Dean of Students for possible referral to the Conduct
Committee. That committee has the authority to impose a range of sanctions, including suspension.
Further information is available at: https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity
(https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity)
Cheating on exams
If you come across a previous quarter’s midterm or final, you are under the obligation of the university’s
“code of conduct” to surrender it (and all copies of it) to me. If, however, you choose to study from a
previous quarter’s midterm or final, no matter how that exam came into your possession, be aware that
you are cheating, and if found out will receive a zero. 

1/25/26, 7:16 PM
CMPSC 130A - DATA STRUCT ALGORTH - Winter 2026
https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/31236
9/13
During exams, you may not look at another student’s test or answers, share your answers/test with
another student, nor remove a test from the exam room. All of these behaviors are forms of cheating
and will result in a zero on the exam, at minimum.
Non-discrimination Policies
Under Title IX, university students are protected from harassment and discrimination based on gender
and sex. If a student feels uncomfortable or in need of support at any time related to their gender, sex,
and/or sexual orientation, please contact your TA and/or course instructor immediately. If a student would
like to disclose information related to pronouns, name changes, or identities, we encourage you to do so.
UCSB's Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity on the 3rd floor of the Student Resource
Building is also available to advocate and be of and support to students.
You can specify your preferred pronouns on GOLD, these are shown in GauchoSpace. Similarly, you
can check others' pronouns when responding to refer to them properly in this class. Remember that it is
always okay to use someone's name to avoid using the wrong pronouns for them. For more information,
visit http://rcsgd.sa.ucsb.edu/education/pronouns
 (http://rcsgd.sa.ucsb.edu/education/pronouns) .
All students have the right to learn and participate in a classroom environment free of intimidation,
harassment, and discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, race, age, sexual orientation,
disability, religious or political beliefs and affiliations. I will address any related issues that surface
immediately; please help me to cultivate a positive classroom environment by communicating any
concerns that you have.
Statement on Sexual Harassment
UCSB does not tolerate sexual harassment/sexual violence, which is prohibited by University policy and
state and federal law. The Title IX Compliance and Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office
(TIX/SHPC) provides assistance in preventing and resolving and investigating complaints of sexual
harassment/sexual violence and gender discrimination. https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix
(https://oeosh.ucsb.edu/titleix)
Mandatory Reporting
As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus.
I want to ensure that students feel they can speak to me, but I also want students to be informed that I
have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as an instructor. I am required to share
information regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on
UCSB's campus or in the community. A result of my mandated report will be that students will receive
outreach and resources from the campus Title IX office. Students may speak to someone confidentially
by contacting CARE, Campus Advocacy, Resources & Education at the 24/7 advocacy line at (805) 893-
4613 or visit them in person at the Student Resource Building.
