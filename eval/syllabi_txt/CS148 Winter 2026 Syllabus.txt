About the Course 
The official course description states: 
Prerequisite: Computer Science 32 with a grade of C or better.​
** Enrollment Comments: Not open for credit to students who have completed Computer 
Science 48 with a grade of C or better. ​
**Repeat Comments: CMPSC 148 is a legal repeat of CMPSC 48. ​
Team-based project development. Topics include software engineering and professional 
development practices,interface design, advanced library support; techniques for 
team-oriented design and development, testing and test-driven development, and software 
reliability and robustness. Students present and demonstrate final projects. 
Make sure that you read this syllabus carefully and are aware of the course policies for this 
term.  Do not automatically assume that the course is the same as the one that you or your 
friends  might have taken before.   
 
Final Course Grades 
Class grades will be assigned based on performance on homework assignments, 
possible in-class assignments, points allotted for work in the Lab sections (toward the 
team projects), and points for the final project product and demonstration. There will be 
a peer-evaluation component based on contributions to the team as well. 
To convert final averages to letter grades, a standard 10 point scale will be used, with 
the upper and lower ends of each range as +/- grades, except for A+ grades, see below. 
There is no “rounding up”; a grade of 86.9999 is a B and a grade of 87.0000 is a B+. 
A+ grades: These may be awarded to the very best performing students in the 
class—but the cutoff for A+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the 
discretion of the instructor (there is no pre-determined cutoff—an average of 97 or more 
doesn’t guarantee you an A+ grade.) The grade of A+ is based on my direct knowledge 
of your outstanding performance and participation as well as my ability to cite 
examples that illustrate how you went beyond the regular class expectations. Such 
knowledge can be gained by having several conversations during office hours, any 
outstanding extra work, your independent projects that use course material, and/or 
helpful and informed participation in class or on the forum, just to name a few 
examples.

Missing homework/in-class activities: Drop the lowest two 
If you miss a class or the submission of any of the above deliverables, you miss the 
opportunity for the points on that deliverable that was due. 
There is no makeup. In lieu of providing a makeup opportunity, we will drop the lowest 
homework/in-class-assignment grades (which may be zeros if you miss an 
assignment.) 
Project Points 
Information about project grading will be discussed in a separate document and 
released during week 2. 
Late Labs 
The policy is simple, and is based on the idea that the primary purpose of the deadlines 
is to allow you as well as the TA to manage workload. To eliminate “context switching” 
between different labs: 
●​ If you want your work to be graded without penalty, turn it in on time. 
●​ If you turn in your lab late, you RISK GETTING A ZERO. 
●​ We will grade late labs ONLY if it creates no extra inconvenience for the graders, 
and we WILL impose a penalty between 10-20% (see the individual grading 
rubrics for the labs.) 
●​ There is NO GUARANTEE that late labs will be graded at all. The TA will simply 
start work at some point after the deadline, and grade until they are finished. At 
that time, we will “close the books” on that particular lab, and any work not 
submitted at that time will NOT be considered. 
Attendance 
This course is, to a large extent, about process, including the process by which 
individuals work together on a team. 
Our class meeting times are the only scheduled times our teams definitely come 
together to meet. So it is essential that you are here.  If you absolutely have to miss 
class, please get notes from your classmates, check EdStem notes to see what you 
missed, and come to the student support hours to work through any material that’s not 
clear.​
 
Questions about grades 
Summary: homework regrade requests must be made only on GradeScope, and always 
within one week. 
From time to time, we may make clerical errors in grading (e.g. adding up points wrong 
or applying a rubric incorrectly.) For this reason, you are encouraged to review your 
grades as soon as they are posted to Gradescope and Canvas. You will typically get an 
email as soon as each grade is posted. From the time the grade is posted, you will have 
one calendar week to submit regrade requests. Requests on homework regrading must 
be made ONLY through Gradescope, ON the correct problem. (Don’t request a regrade 
for question 4 on the page for question 7.) 
Please note that regrade requests based on clerical errors or applying a rubric 
incorrectly are always welcome. Over the course of the quarter, we’ll grade thousands of 
individual problems, so it is unlikely that we won’t make at least some mistakes. 
More problematic are challenges to the rubric itself, e.g. “I don’t think you should have 
taken off so many points for that error” or “I think I deserve more partial credit for that 
incorrect answer”. The instructor and TA will always listen, but please know that we’ve 
put a great deal of thought, time and experience into determining the rubric, and we’ve 
done our best to apply it to all students equitably. You may have a different point of 
view, we will not always agree with your assessment—in fact, we seldom will. As such, 
regrade requests on this basis are not encouraged. It is important to approach such 
conversations in a respectful manner, accepting that the instructor, TA and grader have 
been given responsibility for determining course standards, and applying those in a fair 
way to all students. 
Communication   
For all course-related questions, please use the Discussions tab on EdStem. You can 
also post there anonymously to your classmates. Direct emails are discouraged and 
might not even be seen if “CS148” is not in the subject.  Note that we will always use only 
the official course platforms to reach out to you: posts on EdStem, Canvas, and ucsb 
email. If anyone contacts you through an unofficial channel claiming to be a 
mentor/instructor, offering to help you or to debug your code, please, do not interact with 
them and immediately send a message via Discussions to the Staff. 
 
Accommodations for disabilities 
Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations for exams online 
through the UCSB Disabled Students Program at http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/. Please make 
your requests for exam accommodations through the online system as early in the 
quarter as possible to ensure proper arrangement. 
Managing stress 
Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression, cultural 
differences, can interfere with the ability of students to succeed and thrive. For 
hopefully helpful resources, please contact UCSB Counseling & Psychological Services 
(CAPS) at 805-893-4411 or visit http://counseling.sa.ucsb.edu/ . 
Responsible scholarship 
Honesty and integrity in all academic work is essential for a valuable educational 
experience. The Office of Judicial Affairs has policies, tips, and resources for proper 
citation use, recognizing actions considered to be cheating or other forms of academic 
theft, and students’ responsibilities, available on their website at: 
http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu. Students are responsible for educating themselves on 
the policies and to abide by them. 
Furthermore, for general academic support, students are encouraged to visit Campus 
Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) early and often. CLAS offers instructional groups, 
drop-in tutoring, writing and ESL services, skills workshops and one-on-one 
consultations. CLAS is located on the third floor of the Student Resource Building, or 
visit http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu
