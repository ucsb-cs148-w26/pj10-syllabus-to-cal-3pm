A. Class Overview and Pre-Requisites 
Have you ever wondered how a computer actually computes? Deep beneath your phone’s glossy exterior 
and flashy screen, a network of literally miles of wires carries information between many billions of little 
switches that, when working properly, allow you to run your favorite app. This class is the beginning of 
the story of how that happens. We will explore the fundamental principles of computing hardware, what it 
“means” for a program to actually run on a computer, and start to drill down through intricately stacked 
layers of abstraction that make what you call a “computer” even possible. Along the way you will learn 
some assembly language programming, you will better understand how and why computers are organized 
the way they are, and how to actually start to build your own computers using the basic digital logic design 
elements of gates, combinational circuits, flip-flops, and much more. You are expected to have taken and 
passed (i.e., C grade or higher) CMPSC 16 before you take this course, as well as MATH 3C/4A. 
 
B. What you need to know BEFORE you take this course 
It is very important that you took CMPSC 16 as we will be referring a lot to memory maps, pointers, and 
C/C++ code. You are also expected to be familiar with using the UNIX command line to navigate 
folders, view files, and compile and run programs. In addition, you must have a College of Engineering 
UNIX account ready to use by the end of the first week of class. 
 
C. What you will learn by the end of this course  
You’ll have the opportunity to learn all of these things (though not necessarily in this order): 
• 
Computer organization concepts 
• 
Binary arithmetic and logic operations 
• 
Assembly programming language for 32-bit MIPS architecture, including: 
o Basic arithmetic & variable use 
o Flow control (branching) 
o Memory addressing 
o Functions and function calls 
• 
Basic digital logic design, including: 
o Logic gates and truth tables 
o Combinatorial logic 
o Sequential logic 
o Finite state machine 
 
D. How to succeed in this course   
Come to all the lectures, take good notes, PRACTICE the examples done in lecture, start your homework 
early, and ask us questions often: post on Piazza and come to office hours!!

E. A Note on Conduct: A Shared Expectation of Respect 
Our opportunity to go through this really interesting material together is something that I very much enjoy 
teaching. I truly believe every student entering my class is more than capable of mastering this material 
with some hard work, curiosity, and persistence. Your instructional team will be working hard for you, 
and while we are far from perfect, you should never expect anything less than dignity and respect in 
100% of our interactions. We, in turn, expect the same from you. As professionals, or professionals in 
training, we are all responsible to treat the members of this academic community (e.g. your peers, our 
staff and faculty, and even yourself) respectfully and professionally. With this as our foundation I know 
we can build some wonderful things. 
 
Additionally, I do expect you to be responsible for your own learning and to ask questions. We will 
always strive to make the classroom, the lab, and our offices safe spaces for you to ask questions and to 
learn and, yes, even to make mistakes. Believe it or not, making mistakes is one of the most effective ways 
to learn!  
 
Finally, I do expect you to do your own work at all times. Please familiarize yourselves with the 
university’s policies on academic integrity and honesty and READ the section in this syllabus that details 
this further (on pg. 9). Failure to comply with these policies will result in a zero grade and likely incur 
additional penalties. 
 
F. Where Do I Find Stuff? 
All information you need about what today’s lecture is, to what homework or lab is due today, is found in 
THIS SYLLABUS! Please read this syllabus in its entirety as it contains all the important information on 
how this class runs and what my policies are – I will quiz you about it (for points!) 
 
All material (class slides, example codes, all assignments, grades, etc.) will be listed on our main website 
(Canvas). Please check out our website and familiarize yourselves with it as soon as possible. 
 
All questions you have should be posted on our class’ Piazza site. I encourage EVERYONE to participate 
on Piazza and answer each other’s questions to the best of your ability. My team and I will observe Piazza 
postings and chime-in when needed!

G. Assistance to Students 
01. Office Hours 
I very highly recommend that you come to office hours! Not just for the professor, but also for 
the instructional staff (TAs and ULAs). And not just for this course, but for all of them! 
It can help clarify course material for you and help you how to best study for the course, approach 
your assignments, and prepare for quizzes and exams. It furthermore creates and facilitates 
professional relationships between yourself and the professor and the instructional staff. 
Educational research shows that student engagement is associated with academic success! 
 
Do’s of Office Hours: 
Do go to office hours regularly starting in the first week! 
Do prepare some specific questions: these may be related to the material or syllabus (do read the 
syllabus!) 
Do ask how the professor recommends approaching or preparing for the work you have to do 
Do talk about your aspirations or goals! 
Do feel comfortable asking the professor about how they got into their field and their professional 
life journey 
 
Dont’s of Office Hours: 
Don’t be too intimidated: you really can ask anything you like about the course 
Don’t expect to be tutored or given direct answers to the assignments 
 
02. Lab Sections 
The lab sections are run by the TAs and ULAs. These are excellent spaces to ask questions and 
seek help too! 
 
03. Piazza 
If you have particular questions, you can also ask them on Piazza, day or night. Someone from 
the instructional staff will get back to you quickly, usually within 24 hours. Get into the habit of 
helping out your peers if they ask a question that you know the answer to! You can also see if 
anyone’s asked the same question and received an answer, so make it a habit to check Piazza 
many times a week. See if you can answer your fellow students’ questions yourself! Please do 
not use Piazza to post outright solutions to homework problems – you can, of course, discuss the 
exercises and ways to solve the problems all you like! 
 
04. Email 
If you need to email the professor because you’d rather not share your question on Piazza with 
anyone else, please feel free to do so, but please indicate which course you are in (i.e., put 
“CS64” in the subject line!). Please use direct email and do not send messages thru Canvas, as we 
don’t always read those in time. 
 
All office hours (prof’s, TAs’, ULAs’) are listed on the 1st page of the course’s Canvas site. 
We try not to change them once they’re established in Week 1, but sometimes we unfortunately have to:  
if that happens we will make an announcement on Piazza and we will update the Canvas page.

H. Textbooks and Other Learning Material 
(also used in CS 154 – so keep this copy!!) 
This textbook is very highly recommended (especially if you also decide to take 
CMPSC 154, the follow up to this course). The book is also available to be checked 
out at the UCSB library: 
Patterson, D.A., & Hennessy, J.L. (2013). Computer Organization and Design: The 
Hardware/Software Interface, 5th edition. Morgan Kaufmann. 
 
You can get the (newer) 6th edition instead, if you want to. 
 
 
I will also give you several handouts to read. These will be also announced in class and posted on Canvas. 
 
I. Coding and Software Particulars for this Course 
For a large part of this course, we will be programming in MIPS assembly language. We will use a MIPS 
emulator software to run our programs – more will be explained in lecture. This software is available for 
use on the CSIL machines, which students can also access remotely via ssh. 
 
J. Class Lectures and Lab Sections 
This is a lecture class that meets in-person twice a week and is accompanied by a weekly lab section. 
Attending lectures is VERY important to doing well. Even though I will only take attendance in the 1st week 
of lecture, we will have several participation activities during the scheduled class that cannot be made up 
later. We will take attendance in the first few weekly labs. You cannot make up missed labs sections. 
 
The purpose of the lectures in this course is to guide you through the readings and assignments. 
Especially as it pertains to: 
• 
providing an overview of how everything fits together, 
• 
providing hands-on demonstrations of things that you'll do on your own later, 
• 
providing additional information that is not in the textbook/handouts (and to sometimes clarify 
the textbook/handouts), and 
• 
providing an opportunity to ask questions, and hear answers to questions asked by others. 
 
This course moves quickly, so keeping up with the course material every week is very important and is 
key to doing well in this class.  
 
Labs will be conducted in PHELP 3525 on Tuesdays. I will put up the assignments on our main website and 
you will turn them in online by the posted due date. Lab TAs/ULAs will be available for help in the lab 
sessions. 
 
K. Participation and Attendance 
I will often ask for participation from students. Your active participation will make a difference in your 
learning and your final class grade! 
Students are expected to keep up their attendance of lectures, although I will not actively take attendance 
in class (after Week 1). Attendance is taken in the lab sections and students are allowed to miss up to 2 
sections without penalty.

L. Assignments 
The homework assignments are released on Canvas and Gradescope and students are expected to adhere 
to the course's strict late policy. Assignments have to be submitted ONLY using the Gradescope tool. 
We will not accept nor grade assignments emailed to us.  
 
Most of your assignments will be given to you as a PDF document on the class website. You can print 
this PDF, write your answers on it, then re-scan it, or alternatively you can edit the assignment PDF 
directly using various different software applications (I will list some of these for you on a Piazza post). 
You then have to submit your assignment as your own PDF document on Gradescope. Make absolutely 
sure that you strictly follow the template given to you in the original PDF. Note that only PDF 
submissions that follow the template will be accepted and graded.  
 
The only exception to this, is that a few assignments will be programming-based (C++, MIPS assembly), 
in which case, you’ll be given directions on how to upload them onto Gradescope. 
 
Students are allowed to work together on homework in groups of two (but not more!), and may discuss 
assignment solution details within the group and with other class members. However, each member of the 
group is still accountable for their own work (and every individual should turn in a separate 
assignment). Students may change groups between assignments, though not within an assignment. 
Forming groups is optional; students may work alone if they want. 
 
Please, do not copy material from somewhere else (including online sources, other people, LLMs like 
ChatGPT etc…) WITHOUT giving it proper citation/prompt used – otherwise, it WILL be considered to be 
plagiarism (please familiarize yourselves with my policy and the University’s policy on plagiarism).  
You do not have to cite something the instructor or the TAs explicitly said in lecture or lab. 
 
If you believe that a grade on an assignment question is wrong, you may ask for a review for a possible 
re-grade using Gradescope’s “Regrade Request” feature. Note that such requests will only be made 
available for 3 days after an assignment grade has been released. You should have a good reason to ask 
for a regrade and understand that it is not a guarantee of a grade change. You can ask questions like “why 
did I get this wrong?” or “can you please double-check your grading on this”, but please don’t ask 
questions like, “why did you make this worth X pts? I think you should make it worth Y points instead” 
(reason: assigning points is our prerogative). 
 
M. Quizzes and Exams 
This course has 4 quizzes and 1 final exam:  
• 
The quizzes will take place on the Wednesdays of Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. 
• 
a final exam on Friday, June 13 at 4:00 PM (as set by the University). 
All quizzes and exams will be in-person and in our classroom.  
There are absolutely NO make ups for missed quizzes or exams.  
More details on these quizzes and the final exam will be provided at a later date.

N. Late Policy and Make Up Policy – PLEASE READ! 
A late assignment submission means submitting 24 hours after a deadline. Late submissions will result 
in a 20% penalty. Anything submitted beyond the deadline + 24 hours will receive a zero. No makeup is 
allowed for assignments except in rare cases, if there is a documented family emergency, documented 
extended illness, documented required court appearance, or other situation beyond the students' control 
(with documentation), then the professor may grant additional make up days entirely at the instructor's 
discretion – but this is not a guarantee or a right.  
No makeup is allowed for missed quizzes, tests, or exams whatsoever.

A+ grades: These may be awarded to the very best performing students in the class—but the cutoff for 
A+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no pre-
determined cutoff---an average of 97 or more doesn't guarantee you an A+ grade.) If I decide to curve the 
grade (it’s not guaranteed that I will), I will do so on the final class scores and not on any individual item. 
 
F grades: If you miss your final exam, you will receive an F, regardless of your running score in the 
class. If you feel that I or the TAs have made a mistake (like adding up a grade incorrectly), then you 
should certainly bring that to my attention in an expedient fashion (within one week’s time), but please do 
not engage in grade-grubbing (for example, do NOT ask me to round up your final class grade at the 
end of the quarter). If you have any questions about how grades are computed, please feel free to ask, and 
I would be happy to explain further. 
 
Q. Note to Students with Disabilities 
Please register your accommodation requests with DSP at your very earliest opportunity – this is best 
done by the first or second week of the quarter. Make sure that you submit your DSP request no later than 
one week before a scheduled exam. The instructor will accommodate students only according to 
information gotten from the DSP office. See Section Y (Additional Campus Resources) for contact 
details for the DSP Office.

S. UCSB and Instructor’s Policies on Academic Integrity and Honesty 
Academic Integrity 
It is expected that students attending the University of California understand and subscribe to the ideal of 
academic integrity, and are willing to bear individual responsibility for their work. Any work (written or 
otherwise) submitted to fulfill an academic requirement must represent a student's original work. Any act 
of academic dishonesty, such as cheating or plagiarism, will subject a person to University 
disciplinary action. Using or attempting to use materials, information, study aids, or commercial 
"research" services not authorized by the instructor of the course constitutes cheating. Representing the 
words, ideas, or concepts of another person without appropriate attribution is plagiarism – this includes 
utilizing answers obtained from artificial intelligence (AI) programs and applications. Whenever 
another person's written work is utilized, whether it be a single phrase or longer, quotation marks must be 
used and sources cited. Paraphrasing another's work, i.e., borrowing the ideas or concepts and putting 
them into one's "own" words, must also be acknowledged.  
I will report the violation to the Associate Dean of Students for possible referral to the Conduct 
Committee. That committee has the authority to impose a range of sanctions, including suspension. 
Further information is available at: https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity  
 
Cheating on exams/quizzes 
I have never released an exam/quiz from a previous quarter. Thus, any exam/quiz from a previous quarter 
that you get hold of must have been illegally obtained.  If you come across a previous quarter’s quiz or 
midterm or final, you are under the obligation of the university’s “code of conduct” to surrender it (and all 
copies of it) to me. If, however, you choose to study from a previous quarter’s midterm or final, no matter 
how that exam came into your possession, be aware that you are cheating, and if found out will receive a 
zero. Furthermore, if I discover that a particular organization (e.g., sorority, fraternity, or other club) 
provides to students or maintains an archive of any of my previous exams, I will file a code of conduct 
complaint with the University against the organization.  
During exams, you may not look at another student’s test or answers, share your answers/test with 
another student, nor remove a test from the exam room. All of these behaviors are forms of cheating and 
will result in a zero on the exam, at minimum. 
Inappropriate Use of Course Materials 
My lectures and course materials, including PowerPoint presentations, tests, outlines, and similar 
materials, are protected by U.S. copyright law and by University policy. I am the exclusive owner of the 
copyright in those materials I create. You may take notes and make copies of course materials for your 
own use. You may also share those materials with another student who is enrolled in or auditing this 
course. 
 
You may not reproduce, distribute or display (post/upload) lecture notes or recordings or course 
materials in any other way — whether or not a fee is charged — without my express prior written 
consent. You also may not allow others to do so. If you do so, you may be subject to student conduct 
proceedings under the UC Santa Barbara Student Code of Conduct. Similarly, you own the copyright 
in your original papers and exam essays. If I am interested in posting your answers or papers on the 
course web site, I will ask for your written permission.

Page 10 of 12 
T. Use of LLMs in the course 
Large Language Models (LLM), like ChatGPT and others, are very commonly used by students and I, for 
one, do not want to ban their use. However, like any powerful tool, these LLMs have to be used 
responsibly by the students. This means that if you do use an LLM in your assignments, you have to (a) 
use the tool sparingly (i.e., in a small way only), (b) check that the answer given is indeed correct (they 
aren’t always!), (c) cite the use of the tool in your answer, along with the prompt(s) you used to get your 
answer, and (d) be prepared to answer an oral question by the professor to demonstrate your 
understanding of your answer. Failure to do any of these steps can and will result in plagiarism charges 
and the consequences spelled out in Section S of this syllabus. 
 
U. Non-discrimination policies 
Under Title IX, university students are protected from harassment and discrimination based on gender and 
sex. If a student feels uncomfortable or in need of support at any time related to their gender, sex, and/or 
sexual orientation, please contact your TA and/or course instructor immediately. If a student would like to 
disclose information related to pronouns, name changes, or identities, we encourage you to do so. UCSB's 
Resource Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity on the 3rd floor of the Student Resource Building is 
also available to advocate and be of and support to students. You can also specify your preferred 
pronouns on GOLD. Similarly, you can check others' pronouns when responding to refer to them properly 
in this class. Remember that it is always okay to use someone's name to avoid using the wrong pronouns 
for them. For more information, visit http://rcsgd.sa.ucsb.edu/education/pronouns  
 
All students have the right to learn and participate in a classroom environment free of intimidation, 
harassment, and discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, race, age, sexual orientation, 
disability, religious or political beliefs and affiliations. I will address any related issues that surface 
immediately; please help me to cultivate a positive classroom environment by communicating any 
concerns that you have. 
 
V. Statement on sexual harassment 
UCSB does not tolerate sexual harassment/sexual violence, which is prohibited by University policy and 
state and federal law. The Title IX Compliance and Sexual Harassment Policy Compliance Office 
(TIX/SHPC) assists in preventing and resolving and investigating complaints of sexual harassment/sexual 
violence and gender discrimination. https://titleix.ucsb.edu/  
 
W. Mandatory reporting 
As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I 
want to ensure that students feel they can speak to me, but I also want students to be informed that I have 
a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as an instructor. I am required to share information 
regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on UCSB's campus or 
in the community. A result of my mandated report will be that students will receive outreach and 
resources from the campus Title IX office. Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting 
CARE, Campus Advocacy, Resources & Education at the 24/7 advocacy line at (805) 893-4613 or visit 
them in person at the Student Resource Building.

X. Mental health 
On top of the usual stress factors, switching to in-person education may require some mental adjustment 
or create additional stress. Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression, cultural 
differences, can interfere with the ability of students to succeed and thrive. For helpful resources, please 
contact UCSB Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) at 805-893-4411 or visit
