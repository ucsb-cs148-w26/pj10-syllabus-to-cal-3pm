About the Course
This course is a continuation of Math 3A. We will mainly discuss integral calculus and its applications
(Chapters 5-8 in the textbook). After taking this course, you should be able to:
• Communicate integral calculus through writing and talking
• Evaluate definite and indefinite integrals, using a variety of integration techniques
• Describe area or volume using integrals; and understand this area as a limit of a Reimann sums
• Understand and apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
• Apply techniques of integration to problems from other sciences.
Evaluation Your grade in the course will be determined by the break-down below.
• Individual Quizzes (Qz)
20 %
• Homework (Hw)
20 %
• Participation and Attendance (P)

• Midterm

• Final
30%
The individual quizzes are weekly and will be posted on Canvas after Thursday’s class. It will contain 2
multiple choices and 2 filling in the blanks. The content is not cumulative.
The assignments will be posted on Webwork.
The final has two components. The final part A is like a second midterm. It is required for all students.
The final part B is optional- it may be used to replace your midterm grade, or to make up a midterm. The
final part B is cumulative. Calculators will not be allowed on exams. When I return an exam to you, you
must tell me before leaving the room if you think the grade needs to be changed. Once you leave the room
with your exam, that grade is finalized.
Homework Help:
You may come to my office, and ask questions before and after class. I recommend that you exchange con-
tact information with your peers and get together to study outside of class. The math lab is open every
day from 11-4 in South Hall 1607 math.ucsb.edu/ugrad/mathlab.php . There is also an online version of
the math lab, with many helpful videos: www.math.ucsb.edu/oml/3B.html. You may also get help at CLAS
1
if you choose.
ADA: Students with disabilities can get assistance from the Disabled Students Program (805-893-8897)
or (dsp.sa.ucsb.edu). I will make every reasonable accommodation for any students in the Disabled Students
Program. Please come see me in office hours to discuss any special needs you may have.
A course schedule is on the last page. You are responsible for keeping up with the homework to do well
on quizzes and exams. You may also enter your scores to keep track of your grade. I will not post scores on
Gaucho space, so this is how you will keep track of your progress. You may compute your grade using
My Grade = .2(Qz avg) + .2(Hw avg) + .1(P) + .2(MT) + .3(final).
Grades will be determined by the usual breakdown:
100- 93 % A, 92-90% A-, 89-87% B+, 86-83% B, 82-80% B-, 79-77% C+, 76-73% C, 72-70 % C-, 69-67%
D+, 66-63% D, 62-60% D-, 59% - F.
How to do well in this course:
Do all of the homework, and understand it! Exams and quizzes will look suspiciously like your homework
problems. Come to office hours, and work with other students. Study every day. If you don’t understand a
concept, come to see me immediately.
