Class Attendance
Class attendance is expected: you are responsible for everything that goes on in class. "I wasn't there" and "I didn't know" are not valid excuses for missing something important! Prepare in advance by studying the assigned reading before coming to class and by making sure you understand the previous lecture.

Weekly one-hour discussion sessions, led by the TAs, will focus mostly on (1) presenting supplementary material (such as practical examples) to the lectures and (2) answering questions (about lecture topics, homework problems, programming issues, etc.). Students are required to attend these sessions; you are responsible for the material presented in the discussion sessions. Students are encouraged to give the TAs (and, if appropriate, the instructor) feedback regarding topics or issues they would like to have discussed during this time.

Piazza
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

All the discussions and questions should be posted at: https://piazza.com/ucsb/winter2026/cs165b (access code: cs165b).

Syllabus
(This schedule is relatively fluid and will change as the quarter progresses.)

Notes:
Reading assignments, unless otherwise noted, are from the required textbook.
Readings should be completed before the scheduled class.
Homework is due by 23:59pm PT on the due date, unless otherwise indicated.
