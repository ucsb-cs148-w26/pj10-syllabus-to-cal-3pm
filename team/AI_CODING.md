### Tool Used
- ChatGPT (GPT-4)

### What I Did
- Used AI to generate unit tests for syllabus parsing logic.
- Refined test cases for edge conditions.

### Outcome
- Implemented 3 Jest unit tests.
- Reduced manual debugging time.

### Reflection
- The tool was very useful for brainstorming test cases, but I still had to manually verify correctness and adjust logic. Also, AI output required validation to avoid incorrect assumptions.
