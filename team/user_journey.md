Goal: Enable user to upload their class syllabuses onto calendar easily through a website.  
Need: User is frustrated with disorganized syllabuses and wants a way to organize it on their calendar without reading each one individually.  

User Journey:  
- As a student, I upload syllabus pdfs to the website so that their information is transferred to my calendar.  
- As a student, I can edit my preferences for only certain information (Lectures, sections, tests, assignements, etc) to be transferred to my calendar.
- As a student, I get notified if there is any ambiguity in the syllabi that prevents the website from processing information from a section.
- As a student, I am given the option to manually add information about sections that I was notified about before the website creates the calendar events
